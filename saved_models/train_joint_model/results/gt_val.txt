in a large bowl, combine waffle mix, rosemary, egg, oil, and milk. stir until well combined. pour about ½ cup (120ml) of the batter into the waffle iron (amount may vary based on the size of the waffle iron). cook until the waffle is golden brown. add slices of cheese on half of the waffle. carefully, fold the other half on top and close the lid. cook until the cheese is melted.
cut the watermelon into 1½-inch (4 cm) cubes, removing the rind. using a teaspoon measuring spoon or a melon baller, scoop out the center of each watermelon cube, only going about halfway through. in a large bowl, combine the cucumber, feta, mint, olive oil, and salt. spoon the cucumber mixture into the watermelon cubes. garnish with more mint.
using a sharp knife, cut off the top and bottom of the watermelon to reveal the red flesh and create flat surfaces on both sides. stand the watermelon upright, and slice off the remaining peel so only the red core remains. cut the watermelon into roughly 1-inch (2-cm) cubes and transfer to a large bowl. in a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, water, honey, salt, and pepper. while whisking, gradually add the oil in a very slow, steady stream to create an emulsification. set aside. add the spinach, mango, almonds, and lemon vinaigrette to the large bowl with the watermelon. toss the salad until well-combined, then divide between serving bowls.
in a small saucepan, combine ginger syrup ingredients and bring to a boil. lower to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. strain through a sieve and cool. place the mint and one lime wedge in the bottom of tall glass. muddle well and add 1 ounce (30 ml) of ginger syrup. add the second lime wedge and muddle again. top off glass with the bourbon, ice, and club soda. stir well and garnish with a lime wedge and a few mint leaves.
combine all ingredients in a food processor. blend until smooth adding small amounts of oil and water until desired consistency is achieved. add extra olive oil, dried cranberry, and a sprig of rosemary to garnish! eat with sweet crackers or fresh vegetables.
in a large, ovenproof skillet or frying pan, mix together the carrots, squash, and broccoli, and coat with the oil. spread the veggies into 1 even layer. place the chicken on top of the veggies. season the bird on all sides and in the cavity with salt, pepper, and fresh thyme leaves. while seasoning the bird, make sure that enough seasoning has fallen onto the veggies below to give them good flavor. to truss the chicken, fold the wingtips underneath the breasts so that they fit snugly. using a piece of butcher’s twine, tie the legs together so the bird holds a nice shape. bake for 1 hour, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 160°f (70°c). let the chicken rest for at least 15 minutes once out of the oven, so that all of the juices in the meat can settle and the internal temperature has time to finish rising. carve the bird as desired.
in a large bowl, add the chocolate cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs and whisk until well combined. add the batter to a 9x13 inch (23x33cm) oven proof baking dish, and bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. add the pudding mix and milk to a bowl. whisk until well combined. fold in the whipped cream and crushed cookies until evenly incorporated. using the base of a wooden spoon, poke holes in the cake and fill with the gummy worms. drizzle the cake with chocolate fudge sauce. use a spatula to spread the whipped cream and cookie mixture over the cake. transfer to the fridge to chill for 1 hour. top the cake with remaining gummy worms and crushed cookies.
cut the bananas in half horizontally. insert popsicle sticks in the middle of the banana halves. transfer bananas to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and freeze until solid. in a tall glass or mixing cup, add greek yogurt and almond milk, and mix together. place chocolate chips onto a plate. dip the bananas into the yogurt coating, then roll or sprinkle on toppings. place bananas in freezer until the coating has hardened.
in a pan over medium heat, add the oil and the onions and cook until the onions are translucent. add the garlic and stir to combine. add the black beans, corn, 1 cup (290 g) of enchilada sauce, lime juice, salt, cumin, and chili powder, and stir until combined. cook until just simmering. cut off the end of each zucchini then using a vegetable peeler, peel each zucchini into wide strips. place 4-5 zucchini strips on a plate and spoon a large spoonful of filling at the bottom of the strips. fold the ends of the zucchini over the filling and continue to roll, tightly. transfer the zucchini rolls to a baking dish. spoon over the remaining enchilada sauce and top with cheese. bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted. serve with sour cream and cilantro.
