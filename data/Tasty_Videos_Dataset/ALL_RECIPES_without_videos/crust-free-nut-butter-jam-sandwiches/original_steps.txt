Cut the crust off of the bread and separate the pieces.
Spread the nut butter on both sides of the bread, followed by the jam.
Put the pieces of bread together and pinch all along the sides with your fingers, and then press the seam with a fork to make a seal.
Place in bento box followed by carrots, and blueberries.
Pack bento box in a lunch box with a frozen water bottle to keep everything cold.
Enjoy!
