In a plastic bag, place chicken thighs and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the chipotle powder, garlic powder, cumin, and salt. Seal the plastic bag and massage the meat until fully coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the marinated chicken thighs in the pan and cook for 5 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through.
Cube the chicken thighs on a cutting board and set aside.
In a large bowl, place cooked brown rice, and top the chopped chicken thighs, green peppers, cherry tomatoes, black beans, corns, red onions, and cilantro.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil, lime juice, and season with salt and pepper over the bowl.
Toss until well mixed.
Enjoy!
