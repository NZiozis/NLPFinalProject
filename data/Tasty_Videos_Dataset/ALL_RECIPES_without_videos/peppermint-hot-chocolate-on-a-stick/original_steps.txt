In a saucepan set over medium heat, warm the heavy cream, condensed milk, and peppermint extract and bring to a simmer.
Place chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl, and pour on top the top cream mixture. Allow to stand for 1 minute before stirring to combine.
Using a cookie scoop, spoon the mixture into a silicone mini muffin pan. Garnish each with crushed peppermint candies.
Allow to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes, then insert a popsicle stick into the middle of each.
Freeze for 2 hours, or refrigerate for 4 hours.
To serve, dissolve a stick into a mug of hot milk.
Enjoy!
