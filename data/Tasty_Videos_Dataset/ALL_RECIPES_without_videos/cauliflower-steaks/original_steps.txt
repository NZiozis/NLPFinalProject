Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Remove the green leaves from the cauliflower stem with a knife.
Place the cauliflower core-down on a cutting board and trim 2 sides so they become flat.
Cut the cauliflower in half and then cut each half in two to get 4 “steaks”.
Rinse and dry the cauliflower steaks.
In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, onion, and garlic, plus salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.
Place the cauliflower steaks on the baking sheet and brush generously with the oil mixture.
Bake for about 25 minutes, flipping halfway, until tender.
Serve as desired, such as on a sandwich with pesto and red pepper, or with barbecue sauce and roasted potatoes, or with vegan mushroom gravy and lentils.
Enjoy!
