Mix breading ingredients together in large bowl. Set aside.
*NOTE: You can crush almonds by pulsing them in a food processor or high-speed blender, or by carefully cutting almonds with a sharp knife.
Whisk egg in a separate bowl.
Dredge the salmon in the egg, then the breading mixture.
Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium heat.
Once the pan is ready, add the salmon and let cook on one side for 3-4 minutes until golden brown. Flip and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on the other side.
Serve salmon with a side of your favorite veggies. We used asparagus.
Enjoy!
