In a bowl, add the heavy cream and condensed milk and whip until soft peaks form.
Add the cream cheese and mix until smooth.
Freeze for 3-5 hours.
Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
Open the tubes of cinnamon rolls and save the frosting for later.
Cut 3 of the cinnamon rolls in half.
Unravel the cinnamon roll halves and full cinnamon rolls and roll together the halves with the whole rolls using your hands to create 6 long thin strips.
You’ll have one cinnamon roll left over and you can use that to make a small bowl, or save for later!
Spray an inverted muffin tin with cooking spray and coil the cinnamon roll strip around the outside in order to create a bowl.
Be sure to pinch the ridges together in order to prevent the bowl from separating while baking.
Bake 7-10 minutes, or until the bowls are golden brown.
In a small bowl, add the icing from the cinnamon roll packages and melt for 20-30 seconds in a microwave.
Carefully remove the cinnamon roll bowls from the tins and add 2 scoops of ice cream to each bowl.
Top the ice cream with melted icing and ground cinnamon.
Enjoy!
