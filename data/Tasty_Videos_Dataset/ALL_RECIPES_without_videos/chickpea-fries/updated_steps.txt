Bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
Gradually whisk in 2 cups of chickpea flour.
Continue to whisk until the mixture is thickened to the consistency of thick oatmeal.
Immediately transfer to a greased, baking dish.
[We used an 8x10 (20x25 cm), but a larger one will just produce thinner fries].
Knock the dish on your work surface a few times to ensure that the mixture spreads evenly and to release any air bubbles.
Press plastic wrap over the mixture to ensure a flat surface and refrigerate for 2 hours until it has set firm.
Dipping sauce: In a medium bowl, combine greek yogurt, a pinch of salt, finely chopped parsley, finely chopped dill, clove garlic minced, and lemon juice.
Invert the baking dish on a cutting board (you may have to pull at the edges to release the suction for it to fall out cleanly).
Slice into streak fry sizes.
Shallow fry in oil until each side is golden and crispy.
Salt immediately after coming out of oil.
Enjoy!
