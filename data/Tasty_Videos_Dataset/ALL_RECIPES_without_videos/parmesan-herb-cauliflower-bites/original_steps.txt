Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Break the head of cauliflower into bite-sized florets.
In a large bowl, combine panko, parmesan, salt and herbs.
In a small bowl, whisk the eggs.
Coat each floret in egg, then the parmesan-herb mixture and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 30 minutes or until crispy and golden.
Serve with marinara or your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
