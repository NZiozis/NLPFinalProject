In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chickpeas and cook until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes.
Add the garlic powder, salt, and buffalo sauce and cook for 2 more minutes, until the sauce thickens and the chickpeas have browned.
Set aside.
In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, combine the hummus, lemon juice, and water and whisk thoroughly.
To assemble a wrap, top a tortilla with romaine, chickpeas, tomatoes, and red onion, then pour on the dressing.
Fold in the sides of the wrap and roll up like a burrito.
Cut in half.
Enjoy!
