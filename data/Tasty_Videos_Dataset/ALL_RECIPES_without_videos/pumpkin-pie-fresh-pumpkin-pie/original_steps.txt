Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Gently lay the rolled-out pie crust in a pie dish. Trim the excess dough around the sides.
Tuck the dough under the edge, and crimp the edges using the index finger knuckle on one hand and the thumb and index finger on your other hand. Chill in the refrigerator for 14-20 minutes.
After chilling the crust, crumple a piece of parchment paper, then spread it out in the center of the crust. Add dried chickpeas or baking beans to the center and spread toward the sides of the crust--this will add weight to keep the crust from puffing up and hold up the walls.
Bake the crust for 15-20 minutes, until slightly golden and there are no raw doughy spots.
Cut the sugar pumpkin into 8 wedges. Use a paring knife or spoon remove all of the seeds and pulp.
Place the pumpkin on the prepared baking sheet and dry roast for 15-20 minutes, until tender.
Let the pumpkin cool slightly, then peel off the skin using your hands or a spoon.
Increase the oven temperature to 425˚F (220˚C).
Add 16 ounces (455 g) of the pumpkin to a food processor, along with the cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, salt, vanilla, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and half-and-half. Puree until very smooth, 6-8 minutes.
Pour the filling into the prebaked crust. Brush the edges of the crust with egg wash.
Bake the pie for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) and continue to bake for 30-35 minutes more, until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly when shaken.
Let cool at room temp for at least 2 hours, or in the fridge overnight
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
