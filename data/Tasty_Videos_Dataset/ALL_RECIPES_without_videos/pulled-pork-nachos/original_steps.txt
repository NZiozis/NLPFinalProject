Place pork, onion, and seasonings into a 6-quart slow cooker. Mix to coat meat in seasonings.
Add ketchup and mustard, spreading evenly over the outside of the meat.
Set slow cooker to High and cook for 4 hours, until the meat pulls apart easily. Alternatively, the meat can be cooked on the Low setting for 8 hours.
Remove meat from slow cooker and transfer it to a bowl or cutting board. Using two forks, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces.
Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Using a cast-iron pan or other oven-safe dish, assemble the nachos layer by layer. Chips, then pork, onion, BBQ sauce, and cheese. Repeat as desired for additional layers.
Bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbling.
Top with sour cream, salsa, and cilantro.
Enjoy!
