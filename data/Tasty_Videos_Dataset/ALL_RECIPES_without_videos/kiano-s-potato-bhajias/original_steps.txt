In a large bowl, combine the chickpea flour, rice flour, cilantro, serrano peppers, ginger, garlic, salt, and water. Stir with a rubber spatula until smooth.
Heat 1 inch (2 cm) of oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C).
Working in batches, add the potatoes to the batter and toss to coat.
In batches, transfer the battered potatoes to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, flipping occasionally. Drain the fried potatoes on paper towels.
Serve hot with tomato chutney or your chutney of choice.
Enjoy!
