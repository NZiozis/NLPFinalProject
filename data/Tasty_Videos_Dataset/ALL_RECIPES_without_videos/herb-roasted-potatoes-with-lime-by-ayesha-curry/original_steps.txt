Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
In a large bowl, add the potatoes, butter, shallot, garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary. Toss to combine.
Transfer the potatoes to a greased, parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes. Stir the potatoes, then bake for another 10-15 minutes, until golden brown.
Drizzle the potatoes with lime juice.
Enjoy!
