Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
Add the spinach and artichoke, and stir.
Mix in cream cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese, and stir until the cheeses are well incorporated. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder until evenly coated.
To pound out the chicken, take a chicken breast and butterfly it by slicing half way into it to open like a book, making sure not to slice all the way through. Cover the breast with parchment paper or plastic wrap. Gently pound the meat with a mallet or rolling pin until it is evenly flattened, about ¼ inch (6 mm) in thickness.
Onto each pounded chicken breast, evenly add ¼ of the spinach-artichoke mixture, but making sure to not overfill the chicken.
Carefully roll the chicken breast until the ends overlap and then place the chicken into a greased baking dish.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken is fully opaque and reaches at least 165°F (75°C).
Serve with riced cauliflower, broccoli, or other low carb vegetables of your choice.
Eat right away or refrigerate until ready to eat.
Enjoy!
