Preheat the oven to 200˚C (400˚F)
Add all the rice ingredients in a small saucepan.
Bring to a boil, then turn down to a very low simmer before covering with a tight-fitting lid.
Cook for 15 minutes. While the rice is simmering, prepare the fish.
Take 2 large sheets of baking paper, about 20-30 cm (8-12 inches). Fold in half and cut out a heart shape.
Place a piece of fish on the 1 side of the heart, top with half of the coriander stalks and half of the red onions.
Fold the paper in half and double fold all round to seal in the fish, a bit like a pasty.
Place on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 8 minutes. Once the fish is in the oven remove the rice from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes more. This will further steam the rice, making it soft and sticky.
Meanwhile prepare the dressing. Combine all the ingredients for the dressing, mix well.
Serve with salads or seasonal vegetables.
Enjoy!
