Mash the bananas in a bowl.
Stir in all-purpose flour, rice flour, baking soda and salt until mixed. Mix in sugar.
Heat up cooking oil for deep frying in a small pan.
Once the oil is hot, scoop up a spoonful, roughly a tablespoon, of batter into the frying pan. Deep fry until golden brown.
Place the fritters on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
Serve the fritters with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with chocolate syrup and sweetened condensed milk.
Enjoy!
