In a small bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, Korean red pepper, sugar, and ramen seasoning.
Cut the potatoes into ribboned curls using the ribbon blade on a spiralizer. If you don’t have a spiralizer, insert a skewer into each potato and, working in a spiral motion, cut in the opposite direction you are turning the skewered potato, making a thin, even spiral all the way down the potato. A spiralizer is recommended.
Gather the potato curls together, then wrap each curl around a wooden skewer, spacing out the potato evenly. Set aside to dry for 5 minutes.
Heat the canola oil in a deep pot until it reaches 350ºF (180ºC).
Fry the potatoes until golden brown, 3-5 minutes, then drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet.
While the tornado potatoes are still hot, season with salt and sprinkle with the cheese mixture.
Enjoy!
