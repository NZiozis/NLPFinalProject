Remove the stems from the collard greens, then stack the leaves on top of each other and roughly chop.
Add the collard greens to a slow cooker with the onion, ham hocks, brown sugar, pepper, salt, apple cider vinegar, and chicken broth.
Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours, until the greens are tender.
Remove the ham hocks from the slow cooker. Trim and discard any fat and bones. Roughly chop the meat and return to the greens. Toss to incorporate.
Serve warm.
Enjoy!
