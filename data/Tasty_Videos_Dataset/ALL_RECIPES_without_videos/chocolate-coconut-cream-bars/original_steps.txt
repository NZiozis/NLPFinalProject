Combine shredded coconut, coconut cream, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt to a food processor and blend until mixture becomes easily moldable. You may have to press down the mixture and reblend a few times for this to happen.
Pour mixture into an 8x8-inch (20x20-cm) pan lined with parchment or wax paper. Press down firmly with a rubber spatula and smooth mixture into an even layer.
Freeze for 30 minutes.
Prepare chocolate layer by combining dark chocolate chips and coconut cream in a bowl. Microwave in 15-second intervals, stirring mixture thoroughly in between.
Pour chocolate mixture on top of the coconut cream layer and spread into an even layer with a rubber spatula.
Sprinkle shredded coconut on top.
Freeze for 1 hour, or until chocolate layer has set.
Cut into 16 squares.
Enjoy!
