Scoop out 6 balls of ice cream onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and freeze for at least an hour, or until firm.
Slice pound cake into 1-2 inch (2 ½-5 cm) slices.
Lay three slices of pound cake on plastic wrap side by side and flatten with a rolling pin.
Wrap frozen ice cream ball in pound cake so it’s fully enclosed. Freeze for at least an hour, or until firm.
Make tempura batter by mixing flour, egg, and water a little at a time.
Heat oil to 400˚F (200˚C).
Coat the wrapped ice cream in tempura batter.
Carefully lower the coated ice cream into the oil and cook until golden brown, 15-30 seconds. Don’t cook for too long or else the ice cream will melt.
Remove excess oil by patting with a paper towel.
Serve immediately with your toppings of choice.
Enjoy!
