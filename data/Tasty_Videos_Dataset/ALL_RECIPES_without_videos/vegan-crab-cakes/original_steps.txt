Add chickpeas, hearts of palm, and artichoke hearts to food processor. Pulse until mixture is chopped, yet still slightly chunky.
Transfer mixture to large mixing bowl and add 1 cup (50 g) of bread crumbs, ¼ cup (55 g) vegan mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, salt, pepper, and Old Bay seasoning. Mix well.
Form the mixture into 6 1-inch (2 ½ cm) thick patties.
Dip each patty in remaining bread crumbs.
Heat a pan of oil to 350˚F (180˚C). Fry each patty for 3-6 minutes per side, until golden brown.
Transfer to paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.
For tartar sauce, combine remaining vegan mayo, relish, and 1 teaspoon lemon juice in mixing bowl.
Top the patties with tartar sauce, dill, and lemon juice.
Enjoy!
