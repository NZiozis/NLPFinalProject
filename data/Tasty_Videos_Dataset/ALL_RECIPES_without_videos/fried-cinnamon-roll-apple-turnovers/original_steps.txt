Heat 2 inches (5 cm) of vegetable oil in a pot to 350˚F (180˚C).
Chop Granny Smith apples, transfer to bowl, and pat dry with paper towel.
Mix in 1 tbsp of flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon.
Open your cinnamon rolls, dust your work space with flour, and reserve icing.
Cut the cinnamon rolls in half and dust more flour to roll out each half into a 2x2 in (5x5 cm) square.
Place a dollop of icing and apple mixture onto the square.
Beat egg in a bowl and brush the sides of the square.
Fold the square into a turnover shape and seal closed with your finger, making sure to get the air out from inside.
Primp the edges with a fork.
Place turnovers into oil and fry for about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
Toss in cinnamon sugar. Garnish with powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
