Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Fill a gallon plastic bag with pretzels and use a rolling pin or meat mallet to crush the pretzels, creating a chunky texture.
Combine crushed pretzels and butter in a mixing bowl and stir to combine.
Place the pretzel mixture in the base of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with the mixture to create the crust. Use a measuring cup to smooth the surface.
Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
Place cream cheese in a large bowl and mix with an electric mixer until cream cheese is smooth.
Add in powder sugar, vanilla extract, and sour cream. Mix until combine. Use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl.
Add in the whipped cream until batter is thick and smooth.
Pour the mixture into the 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan and spread with a spatula to cover the pretzel crust and create a flat even top. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes.
Boil water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Once boiling, add the strawberry gelatin and stir for 3 minutes, or until gelatin has dissolved. Remove from heat.
Let gelatin mixture cool for 8 minutes or until room temperature. Add in strawberries and stir to combine.
Remove the springform pan from the refrigerator and pour the strawberry mixture over it. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
Enjoy!
