Use a vegetable peeler to peel the cucumbers.
On a cutting board, cut and discard the ends. Cut the cucumbers in half. Scoop out the seeds and discard.
Spread mustard on one half of the prepared cucumber and mayonnaise on the other.
Layer the roast beef, turkey, ham, and cheddar cheese, and close the sandwich.
Enjoy!
