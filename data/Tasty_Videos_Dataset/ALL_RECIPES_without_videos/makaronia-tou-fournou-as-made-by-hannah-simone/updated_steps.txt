Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a wok or large skillet, pour the red wine.
Add garlic and onion, and sauté until tender.
Add the pork, and cook thoroughly.
Add the cinnamon, 2 tablespoons mint, pepper, and parsley, and mix together.
In a small saucepan, melt butter.
Add flour a little at a time, mixing constantly, until it forms a paste.
Add milk a little at a time, whisking constantly, until fully combined.
Add paprika, and stir until thickened.
In a large casserole dish, lay down half the ziti.
Sprinkle on 1 cup (50g) of halloumi and 2 tablespoons mint.
Top with entire pork mixture, then the remaining halloumi, mint, and pasta.
Top entire mixture with the sauce, and cover with foil.
To prevent foil sticking to the sauce, place a toothpick in each corner of the dish to prop the foil up.
Bake 45 minutes, then broil for 5-10 minutes.
Let cool 15 minutes.
Enjoy!
