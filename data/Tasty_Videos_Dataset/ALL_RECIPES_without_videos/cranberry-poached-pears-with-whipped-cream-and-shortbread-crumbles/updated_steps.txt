In a blender, puree the apple juice, cranberry sauce, and salt until smooth.
Pour the juice into a 4-quart jumbo cooker, add the cinnamon stick, and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Add the pears to the simmering juice, and cook, turning occasionally, until the pears are tender when pierced at the thickest part with a paring knife, 25-30 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and let the pears cool completely in liquid, about 1 hour, or refrigerate in liquid for up to 2 days.
In a large bowl, beat the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla with an electric hand mixer until medium peaks form.
Divide the pear halves among 6 serving bowls and top each with a dollop of whipped cream and drizzle with some of the poaching liquid.
Crumble 2 cookies over each bowl and serve.
Enjoy!
