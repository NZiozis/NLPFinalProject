Heat a pan over medium-high heat.
Add the sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and milk, and whisk until smooth.
Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
Let the pan cool.
Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap, or use popsicle molds.
Pour mixture into pan.
Freeze for about 5 hours, until firm enough to stick popsicle sticks in.
Gently slide each popsicle stick into chocolate, leaving about 2 inches (5 cm) in between each stick.
Continue with the next row.
There should be about 8 sticks per row, 16 popsicle sticks total.
Continue to freeze for another 4 hours, until completely frozen.
Remove the loaf pan from the freezer, and pull the plastic wrap upward releasing the chocolate.
You may need to use a spatula to help release chocolate from pan.
Slice and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
