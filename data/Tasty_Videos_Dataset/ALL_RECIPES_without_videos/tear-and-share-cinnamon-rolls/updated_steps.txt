Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
In a smaller bowl, mix the egg yolks, milk, and butter until combined.
Whisk into the flour mix until a dough is formed, using your hands, if necessary.
In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients needed for the filling.
Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface until the size of a sheet of paper.
Spread the filling evenly, and then roll up tightly.
Cut into 8 equal rolls and arrange in an ovenproof dish so that they are all tightly pushed together.
Bake for 35 minutes.
Serve with icing.
Enjoy!
