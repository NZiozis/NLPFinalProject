In a heated pot, melt butter and olive oil.
Add garlic and shrimp, seasoning with salt and pepper.
Cook until shrimp is pink, then put aside.
In the same pot, add milk, broth, and pasta.
Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, so that the pasta does not stick to each other.
Once pasta is al dente, add in spinach, salt, pepper, seasoning, and cheese, and mix until spinach is wilted and everything is coated in the sauce.
Add the shrimp back in and give it a stir until fully incorporated.
Serve with some extra parmesan cheese, if desired.
Enjoy!
