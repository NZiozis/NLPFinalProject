Measure ¼ cup (60 ml) of wine and set aside.
Combine the water and the remainder of the bottle of wine in a large pot and bring to a boil.
Once boiling, add spaghetti and cook (stirring frequently) until al dente, about 7 minutes.
Reserve ¼ cup (60 ml) of the cooking liquid and drain the spaghetti. Set aside.
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil on medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the reserved cooking liquid and reserved wine to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Add the pasta and toss to coat with the sauce.
Add the butter and stir until it melts into the pasta.
Add salt and pepper, parmesan, and parsley. Stir to combine.
Serve on its own or top with more parmesan and parsley and open up another bottle of wine!
Enjoy!
