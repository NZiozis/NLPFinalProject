In a pot over medium heat, add the olive oil, onion, garlic, and tomato paste. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until the tomato paste has caramelized.
Add the canned tomatoes, dried oregano, and dried basil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the desired thickness.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Enjoy!
