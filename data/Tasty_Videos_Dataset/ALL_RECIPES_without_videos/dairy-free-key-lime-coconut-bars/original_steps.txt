The night before you intend to make your key lime bars, place cashews in a bowl of water and let soak overnight.
Add walnuts, coconut, dates, vanilla extract, water, and salt to a food processor or blender and pulse until sticky mounds begin to form.
Press the crust into an 8x8-inch (20x20-cm) freezer-safe, parchment paper-lined pan.
Drain the cashews well and add to the food processor. Blend until smooth.
Scrape down the sides of the processor and add lime juice, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and lime zest.
Blend until smooth, adding the coconut oil halfway.
Spread the mixture on top of your crust and garnish with more lime zest and coconut.
Cover with foil and freeze for 3 hours or until set.
Remove from freezer, slice, and serve.
Enjoy!
