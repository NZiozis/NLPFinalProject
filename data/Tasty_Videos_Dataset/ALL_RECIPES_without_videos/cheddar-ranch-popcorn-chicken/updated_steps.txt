Chop chicken breasts into bite-size pieces.
In a large bowl, combine chicken, buttermilk, and ranch packet.
Refrigerate for 2 hours.
In a large ziplock bag, crumble the cheese crackers into desired crumbs (to replace bread crumbs).
Place cracker crumbs into a medium bowl and coat each piece of chicken until fully covered.
Heat oil to 350°F (180°C) and fry chicken until crackers turn golden brown (3 minutes).
Place on a paper towel to dry.
Serve with a side of ranch or any sauce.
Enjoy!
