In a medium bowl, soak the lentils in cold water for 3 hours.
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
In a food processor, combine the lentils, carrot, corn, peas, vegan cheese, oregano, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and garlic, and pulse until well mixed.
Take about 1 tablespoon worth of mixture and form it into a nugget with your hands.
Pan fry with a small drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Or, you can bake them on a piece of parchment paper at 400˚F (200˚C) for 20 minutes, flipping after the first 10 minutes.
Allow to cool 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
