In a large pot, heat the canola oil over medium heat.
Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion, celery, and garlic and saut√© until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the carrots and continue cooking for another 2 minutes, until all of the vegetables are heated through.
Add the chicken broth, salt, pepper, garlic powder, dill, chives, and parsley.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for about 30 minutes, until vegetables are tender.
When ready to serve, add the matzo balls to the simmering soup and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Ladle into bowls.
Enjoy!
