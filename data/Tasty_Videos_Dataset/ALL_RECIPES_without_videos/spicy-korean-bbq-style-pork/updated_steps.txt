Slice the pork into extremely thin slices, then transfer to a large bowl.
This works best when the pork is super cold or partially frozen.
Add in all of the ingredients besides the canola oil, then mix until the pork and the vegetables are evenly coated with the marinade.
Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Heat the oil in a pan over high heat, add pork, being sure not to crowd the pan, stir-fry the pork in batches until slightly crispy on the edges, about 3-4 minutes.
If youâ€™re using pork belly, cook for a bit longer, around 6-7 minutes.
Sprinkle a bit of sesame seeds on top, then serve with rice!
Enjoy!
