Slice the avocados in half, and then slice lengthwise into wedges.
Mix the bread crumbs with the cayenne pepper and salt.
Roll the slices in flour, then in the whisked eggs, then in the breadcrumbs.
Place the slices on wax paper on a baking sheet. Spray well with cooking spray. Add a sprinkle of black pepper if desired.
Bake for approximately 12 minutes at 400˚F (205˚C). Flip all the way through and re-spray.
Serve with your favorite dipping sauce!
Enjoy!
