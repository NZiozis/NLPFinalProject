To a pot with 2 cups (480 ml) of boiling water add the ramen seasoning packet and a tablespoon of butter. Stir until the butter melts and then add the ramen noodle cube and cook until the noodles become tender, 2 minutes. Pour the ramen into a bowl.
To the prepared ramen, add the soy sauce and stir to incorporate.
Top with the nori, egg, bacon, scallions, and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using.
Enjoy!
