Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Unroll pie crusts and cut in half. Cut out a 5-inch-wide (12-cm) square in each half. Rotate the squares to resemble diamond shapes.
Use leftover pie crust to cut out 4 small hearts with a heart-shaped cookie cutter. Set aside.
Fold four sheets of aluminum foil into small rectangles. Using your finger, slightly open the inside of each rectangle.
Place the foil packets in the center of each pie crust diamond.
Dip your finger with water and wet the edges of the left, bottom, and right flaps.
Apply cooking spray to the tops of the aluminum foil packets.
Following the folds of a real envelope, close the flaps over the foil, leaving the upper flap open.
Wet one side of the pastry hearts and arrange them wet side down onto the folded edges of the pastry envelopes.
Place pastries onto parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sparkling sugar.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Place a piece of aluminum foil over the top flaps of the envelopes if they begin to brown before the rest of the envelope.
Cool completely before stuffing with strawberry slices.
Enjoy!
