Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
On a cutting board, use a vegetable peeler to peel the carrot into ribbons.
In a small bowl, mix carrot ribbons with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Toss until well coated.
Transfer carrot ribbons to a baking sheet.
Bake for 10-15 minutes flipping halfway through.
If carrots need more crisping, turn oven down to 300˚F (150˚C) and bake for additional 5 minutes, or until desired crispiness is reached.
Enjoy!
