Preheat the oven to 350F˚ (180C˚).
In a large bowl, add the short ribs, all vegetables, herbs and black pepper to taste for the marinade.
Add the wine to cover.
Marinate at least 6 hours in the fridge.
Remove the meat from the marinade and pat dry with a towel or paper towel.
Strain the veggies from the wine.
Reserve both the wine and veggies for later.
Season the meat with a generous amount of salt and pepper.
Coat each side with flour and set aside.
In a large ovenproof pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat on the stovetop.
When the oil begins smoking, carefully slip ribs into the pot and sear until well-browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Transfer ribs to plate.
In the same pot, sauté the veggies from the marinade until lightly caramelized and browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add the wine in the pot, stirring to deglaze.
Add tomato paste and stir to dissolve.
Bring the liquid to a boil so the alcohol from the wine evaporates.
Add beef broth and bring it back to a boil.
Add the ribs back to your pot.
Spoon the liquid over the ribs to coat them.
Cover the pot and transfer to the middle rack of your oven.
Bake until meat is tender enough to be pierced easily with fork, about 2½ hours, opening the oven every 30 minutes and carefully skimming the fat from surface.
Serve with mashed potatoes, or another side of your choice, and garnish with chopped parsley on top.
Enjoy!
