Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Mix the brown sugar and mustard in a small bowl.
Score the pre-cooked ham and brush the mustard mixture over the ham. Roast the ham for 20 minutes.
Wrap the ham in crescent roll dough.
Place the wrapped ham on parchment-lined baking sheet and brush with egg wash. Bake for another 20 minutes.
While the ham is baking, make the apple cider sauce. In a medium pot, bring the apple cider, cider vinegar, honey, mustard, and chili powder to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the sauce thicken.
Slice the ham and serve with the apple cider sauce.
Enjoy!
