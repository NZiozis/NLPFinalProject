In a small bowl, whisk together the flax meal and 9 tablespoons of cold water. Set aside for 15 minutes, until thickened and gel-like.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, mix together the brown rice flour, quinoa flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Create a well in the center of the mixture. Pour the flax mixture, remaining ¼ cup (60 ml) cold water, and olive oil into the well. Begin to mix dough together with spatula, then transfer the dough to a clean surface and knead until dough comes together and there are no dry spots remaining. Transfer dough back into bowl and cover. Let rest for 20 minutes to allow the flours and xanthan gum to hydrate.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Season generously with salt.
Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a flat rectangle. Working 1 portion at a time, lightly dust with flour and use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out to a long, thin rectangle about 3 inches (7 cm) wide and 12 inches (30 cm) long and ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1 ½ cm) thick.
Feed the rectangle through a pasta roller, starting on the thickest setting and gradually increasing the setting with each pass until the dough is approximately half as thick, but not so thin that it tears.
Cut the pasta sheets in half. Feed each half through a fettuccine cutter and twirl each portion into nests on the prepared baking sheet while you cut the rest of the pasta.
Boil the pasta for 2-3 minutes, until al dente but not falling apart.
Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce of your choosing.
Enjoy!
