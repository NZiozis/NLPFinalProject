In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract until smooth.
Add in the strawberry jam and fresh strawberries, and beat until combined.
Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the pancake mix and flour until fully incorporated. (The dough will be sticky and pink in color.)
Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and sprinkle the top with more flour.
Press out dough until it is about half an inch thick.
With a round cookie cutter, drinking glass, or mason jar lid, cut the dough in as many circles as will fit. In the center of each circle, cut a smaller circle with a cookie cutter or shot glass.
Remove the cut donuts to another floured surface and gather up excess dough.
Repeat steps 5 through 7 until all the dough is used up.
Heat oil in a large pot to 350ºF (180ºC).
Carefully place a few donuts in the hot oil, being careful not to crowd the pot.
Once the bottom is browned, flip the donut over in the oil and cook the other side.
Once both sides are browned, remove the donut and place it on a rack to cool.
For the frosting: beat cream cheese in a bowl until smooth. Add powdered sugar and continue to beat until fully incorporated, then add vanilla extract, and finally add milk.
Dunk the tops of the donuts in the frosting and garnish with slices of fresh strawberries.
Enjoy!
