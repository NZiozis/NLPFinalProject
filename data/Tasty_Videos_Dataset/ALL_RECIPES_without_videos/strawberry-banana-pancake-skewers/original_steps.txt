In a large mixing bowl combine the dry ingredients by sieve.
Beat together the egg, milk and butter in a separate bowl, then combine with the dry ingredients.
Gently whisk the mixture just enough to moisten the flour to be sure not to over mix. Transfer the batter into a larger squeeze bottle.
On a non-stick pan, squeeze a quarter-sized amount of the batter. Flip when bubbles rise and the bottom has browned.
When the pancakes are done, start assembly from bottom to top with a pancake, strawberry, banana. Repeat twice finishing with a pancake on the top and a skewer down the center. NOTE: Feel free to use any fruit combinations to your liking.
Finish with powdered sugar and maple syrup.
Enjoy!
