Cut the hot dog into six equal sized pieces.
Then cut puff pastry into sections just large enough to wrap around the pieces of hot dog.
Wrap the hot dogs with the cut puff pastry.
Place them on a baking sheet or foil in two rows of 3 with just a little space between each.
Top with cheese and scallions and bake at 400°F (204°C) for 25 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
