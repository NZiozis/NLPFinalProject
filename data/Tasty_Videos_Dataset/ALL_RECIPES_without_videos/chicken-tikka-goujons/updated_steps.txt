Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
Cut the chicken breasts into thin strips.
In a re-sealable bag, mix the marinade ingredients together and place the chicken strips inside.
Make sure they are thoroughly covered and marinate in the fridge for 2 hours (or more if you want a stronger flavour).
Remove the chicken from the marinade and cover in flour, then egg, then panko breadcrumbs.
Bake for 25 minutes.
Enjoy!
