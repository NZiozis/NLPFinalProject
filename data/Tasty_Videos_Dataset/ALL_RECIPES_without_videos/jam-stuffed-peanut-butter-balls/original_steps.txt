Using a small spoon or a teaspoon measuring spoon, scoop out balls of jam and lay them on a sheet pan or plate lined with parchment paper. Pop the jam balls in the freezer for around a half hour, or until they’ve firmed up a bit.
In a mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, one cup of oats, and powdered sugar, and mix them all together until they’re well combined.
Grab a palmful of the peanut butter mixture (around the size of a golf ball) and then, using your hand and fingers, shape it into a mini pancake.
Grab one of the firmed-up jam balls and twist it around until it’s even more of a sphere, then lay it in the middle of your mini peanut butter pancake.
Using your fingers, lift up and pinch the edges of the peanut butter so that they’re coming up around the jam ball. Continue this until the peanut butter mixture totally encloses the jam and you’ve created a ball. Roll each ball in your hands so that it’s nice a smooth.
Once you’ve created all of the balls, roll each one in oats and then pop in the refrigerator or freezer to chill. (If you’re freezing, make sure to bring the balls back to room temperature before serving).
Enjoy!
