Using a serrated knife, slice the baguette crosswise on a slight diagonal into ½-inch (1 cm) slices.
Transfer the baguette slices to the prepared baking sheet.
Top each piece of bread with 1-2 slices of Brie cheese.
Bake for 5 minutes, or until Brie begins to bubble and the bread is toasted.

Drizzle with honey.
