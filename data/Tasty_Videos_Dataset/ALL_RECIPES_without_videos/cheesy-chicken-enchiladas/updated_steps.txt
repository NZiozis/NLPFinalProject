Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Mix the chicken, half of the enchilada sauce, and half of the cheese blend in a bowl.
Wrap the tortillas in a paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds.
Place the chicken on the tortilla and roll tightly.
Place the enchiladas in a baking pan and top with remaining sauce and cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until cheese has melted.
Top with sour cream and cilantro.
Enjoy!
