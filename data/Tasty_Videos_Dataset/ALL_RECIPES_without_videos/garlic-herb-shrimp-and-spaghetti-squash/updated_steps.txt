Using a fork or knife, carefully poke holes along the middle of the squash.
Microwave for 5 minutes so the squash softens and is easier to cut.
Cut in half horizontally and scoop out the seeds.
Drizzle olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Place in the Instant Pot and secure the lid until you hear the beep.
Tip: Closing the lid can be tricky.
Have the pressure knob at 11 o’clock and turn right.
Set the pressure knob on the top of the lid to Sealing.
Select “Manual” and reduce to 7 minutes.
It will say “On” in a few seconds.
Note: the Instant Pot will need to warm up for 5-10 minutes.
Steam will be released and a few minutes later, the time will start counting down.
While the squash is cooking, prepare the shrimp.
Place the shrimp in a bowl and add the minced garlic, onion powder, parsley, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
Mix until combined.
Refrigerate until ready to cook.
Once the 7 minutes is up, let the squash rest in the pot for 5 minutes.
It will count up and read “L 0:05”.
Using a towel or mit, release the pressure knob from “Sealing” to “Venting”.
After the steam has been released, carefully take the squash out of the pot and let it rest in a bowl.
Drain the excess liquid and clean the pot.
To cook the shrimp, select “Saute” on the Instant Pot.
Once it says “Hot”, add the oil.
When the oil is shimmering, add the shrimp in a single layer (cook in batches if necessary).
Cook for 3-5 minutes per side or until opaque.
Press “Cancel” and remove the shrimp.
Using a fork, shred the inside of the squash.
Serve the spaghetti squash and shrimp together.
If desired, top with parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.
Enjoy!
