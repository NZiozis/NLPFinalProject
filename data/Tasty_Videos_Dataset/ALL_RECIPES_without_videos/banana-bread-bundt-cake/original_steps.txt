Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a bundt pan with nonstick spray.
In a large bowl, mash the bananas. Add the eggs, yogurt, honey, and vanilla and whisk to combine.
Add the flour and baking soda and stir with a rubber spatula to incorporate. Fold in the walnuts.
Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.
Bake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times may vary, so keep an eye on the bread.
Invert the cake onto a wire rack set over a baking sheet and let cool completely.
Make the frosting: In a small bowl, mix together the powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of Greek yogurt. Add more yogurt as needed until your desired consistency is reached.
Pour the frosting over the bread. Quickly sprinkle more walnuts on top before the frosting sets.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
