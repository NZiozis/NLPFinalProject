Cook spaghetti in boiling salted water until it’s al dente.
Reserve 1 cup (235 ml) of the pasta water before draining.
While the spaghetti is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pan (it should be large enough to toss the pasta in).
Add garlic and tomatoes, and stir until well-incorporated.
Season with salt and pepper.
Cook tomatoes down for 5 minutes until they soften and release some of their juices.
Then add the wine and allow that to reduce for 5-10 minutes until you’re left with a syrupy sauce.
Add the pasta to your sauce, along with a splash of pasta water and toss to coat it for about 1-2 minutes so the pasta finishes cooking and absorbs the flavor of the sauce.
Add the parmesan and basil.
Add another small splash of pasta water, if needed.
Toss until the cheese is melted down and you’re left with a smooth sauce.
Gradually add small amounts of pasta water, as needed, until the sauce reaches your desired smoothness.
Top off with extra parmesan and basil and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
