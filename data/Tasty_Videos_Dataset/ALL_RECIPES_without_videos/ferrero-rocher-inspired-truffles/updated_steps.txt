Blend up the malted milk biscuits and put them into a big mixing bowl.
Fold in the rice cereal and the Nutella.
Take a big pinch of the mixture and roll into balls using your hands.
Place the shaped mixture onto some baking paper and chill for 1 hour.
Break up the chocolate and microwave it for 30 seconds, then stir.
Microwave for another 30 seconds stirring again, add the butter and stir until you have a smooth mixture.
Dip the Nutella balls into the chocolate coating them generously and place back onto the baking paper.
Chill for a further 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Enjoy!
