Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Prepare the yellow cake batter according to package instructions and pour into greased pan.
Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
Cool to room temperature.
In a medium bowl, crumble the cake.
Add vanilla frosting to give some moisture to the cake.
If it is too dry add more frosting.
Using a small ice cream scoop, portion the cake and shape into a ball.
Repeat with remaining cake.
Dip a popsicle stick tip into the melted white chocolate and insert into the cake balls.
Freeze for at least 30 minutes.
In a small bowl, add the 3 tablespoons of water and gelatin.
Let bloom for 5 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, combine ¼ cup (60 ml) water, sugar, and condensed milk.
Bring to a boil over high heat.
Remove the pan from the heat and add the bloomed gelatin.
Whisk until well combined.
Add the white chocolate to a bowl.
Pour the condensed milk mixture through a sieve into the bowl of chocolate and let it sit for 2 minutes to soften the chocolate.
Using a emersion blender, blend the chocolate until smooth.
Transfer the mixture into a deep container such as a mug.
Squeeze light blue, purple, then navy food coloring into the mug or bowl without stirring.
Dip the frozen cake pop into the chocolate and twist as you pull up creating a marbled pattern.
Stick in a piece of styrofoam and dry the pop completely.
Repeat with remaining cake pops.
Enjoy!
