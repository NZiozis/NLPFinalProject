Follow instructions on cake mix to bake. Bake according to package.
While they bake, finely chop five to seven strawberries until they are almost a pulp.
Cut the tops off of 12 strawberries. Set aside.
In a bowl, beat the whipping cream, chopped strawberries, and powdered sugar until the mixture forms stiff peaks when the beaters are lifted up. Set aside.
Let the cupcakes cool completely, then cut a hole in each one about the width of a quarter (leave room at the bottom of the cupcake).
Press a strawberry, pointed side down into each cupcake.
Then top with whipped cream
Enjoy!
