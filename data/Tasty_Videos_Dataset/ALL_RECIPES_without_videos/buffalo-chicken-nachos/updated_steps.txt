Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C.
In a bowl, mix the chicken with the hot sauce and the ranch.
In a large pan or skillet, lay down half of the tortilla chips, followed by half of the buffalo chicken, Monterey Jack, tomato, and green onions.
Repeat with the remaining half of the ingredients.
Bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
