Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a bowl, mix together the meatloaf ingredients.
Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
Fill the muffin liners with the meatloaf mixture and pat down to form a dome.
Bake meatloaf cupcakes for 25-30 minutes or until cooked through.
In a saucepan over medium heat, add the potatoes, water to cover the potatoes, and salt.
Bring potatoes to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover.
Simmer for 15-20 minutes or until potatoes are fork-tender.
Drain the water and add in the butter and milk.
Mash the potatoes with a fork until smooth.
Fill a ziplock bag with the mashed potatoes.
Pipe the potatoes onto each meatloaf cupcake to resemble frosting.
Sprinkle with parsley.
Enjoy!
