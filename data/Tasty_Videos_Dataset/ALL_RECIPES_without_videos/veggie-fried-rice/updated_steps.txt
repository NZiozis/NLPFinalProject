In a wok or deep skillet, heat up the oil over high heat and cook carrots, onions, and garlic until onions are translucent.
Add bell peppers and broccoli and cook an additional 3-4 minutes.
Push all of the cooked vegetables to the side of the pan.
Beat the eggs and pour into the cleared half of the pan.
Scramble the eggs and mix with the rest of the vegetables.
Add peas, corn, rice, soy sauce, sesame oil, and pepper.
Mix well and let the rice cook until slightly crispy.
Enjoy!
