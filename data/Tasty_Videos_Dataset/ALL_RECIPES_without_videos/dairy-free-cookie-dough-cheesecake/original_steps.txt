The night before you intend to make the “cheesecake,” place the cashews in a medium bowl and cover with water. Soak overnight.
To make the crust, add the walnuts, almonds, dates, coconut, vanilla extract, water, and salt to a food processor or blender and pulse until sticky mounds begin to form.
Press the crust into a 7-inch (18 cm) springform pan lined with parchment paper. Set aside at room temperature.
To make the cookie dough, add the flour, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt to a medium bowl. Stir until a soft dough forms.
Fold in the chocolate chunks, then cover and chill in the refrigerator while you make the filling.
Drain the cashews and add to a food processor, along with the maple syrup, coconut oil, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Blend until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as needed.
Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator and use your hands to form ½-inch (1 cm) cookie dough balls. Sprinkle a handful of cookie dough balls over the crust, saving some for later.
Pour the cashew filling gently and evenly over the cookie dough balls and crust. Gently spread the mixture to cover all of the cookie dough balls.
Top with the remaining cookie dough balls, then cover and freeze for about 2 hours to set. Then, transfer to the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Enjoy!
