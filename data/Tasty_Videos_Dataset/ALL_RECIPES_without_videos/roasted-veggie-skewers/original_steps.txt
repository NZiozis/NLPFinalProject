Preheat grill to medium heat.
Combine the oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper, stirring until mixed.
Slide a zucchini slice down the skewer, followed by pieces of mushroom, red onion, and peppers, until there is a 1-inch gap at the top of the skewer. Brush each skewer liberally with the oil mixture.
Repeat with the remaining skewers and vegetables.
Grill the skewers for 12-18 minutes with the lid closed, flipping halfway.
Enjoy!
