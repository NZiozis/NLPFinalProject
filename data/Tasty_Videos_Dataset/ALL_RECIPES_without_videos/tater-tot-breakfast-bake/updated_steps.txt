In a bowl, beat the eggs with milk, salt, and pepper.
Set aside.
Spread the sausage over the bottom of a glass 9×13-inch (35 cm x 25 cm) baking dish.
Pour on the onion soup, and mix with the sausage.
Sprinkle the cheddar cheese evenly over the top.
Cover with the lined up tater tots, and pour the egg mixture over everything.
Bake uncovered at 350°F (180°C) for one hour.
Enjoy!
