NOTE: For this recipe, be sure to use a no-stir, all-natural peanut butter. Using a natural peanut butter that separates may cause the ball mixture to be too loose.
In a medium bowl, add together the peanut butter, almond flour, honey, and vanilla extract.
Mix until the mixture thickens and sticks together.
Roll the mixture into balls half an inch (1 Â¼ cm) in diameter.
In a small bowl, melt the dark chocolate chips in the microwave no more than 15 seconds at a time.
Using a spoon or fork, dip the peanut butter balls in the melted chocolate and toss to fully coat.
Transfer the balls to a wax or parchment paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate at least one hour.
Enjoy!
