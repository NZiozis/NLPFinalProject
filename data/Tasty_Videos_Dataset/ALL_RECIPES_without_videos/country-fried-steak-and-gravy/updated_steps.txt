Preheat the oven to 225˚F (110˚C).
Set a steak in the center of a cutting board and cover with a piece of plastic wrap.
Using a meat mallet, pound the steak evenly to ¼-inch (½ cm) thick.
Season with salt and pepper on both sides.
Repeat with the remaining meat.
In a wide, shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and 1 cup (240 ml) of milk.
In a separate shallow dish, mix together the 1 ½ cups (190 g) of flour, pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika.
Dredge the steaks in the flour mixture, then dip in the egg mixture, letting any excess egg drip off.
Coat again in the flour mixture.
Set aside for 10-15 minutes, until the coating has dried out a bit.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 10-inch (25.5 cm) pan over medium-high heat until it reaches 375˚F (190˚C).
Fry the steaks, 2 at a time, for 3 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.
Flip and cook on the other side for 3 minutes more, until golden brown and cooked through when the internal temperature reaches 155˚-165˚F (170˚-175˚C).
Transfer the steaks to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet and immediately season with salt.
Once all of the steaks are done frying, transfer to the oven while you prepare the gravy.
Pour the hot oil into a heatproof bowl and let cool before discarding.

Leave any browned bits in the pan.
In the same pan, without wiping it out, melt the butter over medium heat.
Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of flour, whisking to incorporate.
Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the roux is a light brown color.
Add the heavy cream and remaining milk.
Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, 5-7 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper.
Ladle the gravy over the steaks and serve with your favorite side dishes.
Enjoy!
