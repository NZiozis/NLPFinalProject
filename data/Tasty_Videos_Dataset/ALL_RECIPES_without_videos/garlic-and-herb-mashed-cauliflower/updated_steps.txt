Wrap cauliflower in a clean dish towel, then turn it upside down and bang it against the surface of your counter until you feel the cauliflower crack (be sure to rotate to break it up on all sides).
Pull florets off of stem and break the bigger florets into smaller pieces.
Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat.
Add the cauliflower pieces to the pot and boil, covered, for 15-18 minutes.
Drain the cauliflower.
Mash the cauliflower with a fork until smooth.
Mix in remaining ingredients.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
