Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Crisp bacon over medium heat.
Allow it to cool, then crumble.
Generously grease a large bundt pan with cooking spray.
In a bowl, mix both kinds of cheese.
Cut each biscuit into four pieces.
Flatten each piece in the palm of your hand and add a pinch of the mixed cheeses and crumbled bacon.
Gather the edges and pinch the biscuit into a ball.
In a small bowl, mix melted butter, Italian seasoning, and garlic.
Drop the biscuit pieces in the butter mixture and place in the bundt pan.
Bake 30-35 minutes or until golden-brown.
(Be careful - the butter may begin to smoke toward the end of the bake time.
If it begins to smoke, remove from the oven.)
Let stand for five minutes, then place a heatproof plate on top of the pan.
Using a pot holder, flip the pan and plate over and invert onto your serving plate.
Be careful as the pan will still be hot.
Sprinkle with parsley.
Enjoy!
