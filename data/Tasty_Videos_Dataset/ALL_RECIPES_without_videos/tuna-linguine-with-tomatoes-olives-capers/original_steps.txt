Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain.
Add the olive oil, garlic, and chile flakes to a large saut√© pan. Turn the heat to medium-low and slowly heat up until the garlic is fragrant and lightly colored, about 3 minutes.
Add the oregano, capers, olives, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the tuna and cook for another minute.
Toss in the cooked pasta.
Enjoy!
