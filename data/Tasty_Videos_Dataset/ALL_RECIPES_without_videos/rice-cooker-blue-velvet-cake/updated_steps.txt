Mix until smooth.

Check the doneness of your cake with a toothpick.
If you insert the toothpick, then remove it, and it is clean, the cake is done.
Once the cake is done cooking, remove from rice cooker and let it sit for 15 minutes to cool down.
Flip over and out and cut in half.
Chill in the refrigerator so itâ€™s easier to ice.
