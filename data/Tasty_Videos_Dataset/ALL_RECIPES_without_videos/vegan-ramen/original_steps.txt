In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and onions and saut√© until onions become translucent.
Add vegetable stock, water, shiitake mushrooms, and soy sauce. Stir and simmer for at least 45 minutes, up to 3 hours. The longer you simmer, the more flavorful the broth will become.
Uncover the pot, add the miso paste, and stir.
Ladle the broth into a bowl and add noodles and toppings of your choice.
Enjoy!
