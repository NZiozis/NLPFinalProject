Preheat the oven to 400℉ (200℃).
Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Reserve a few broccoli florets, then place the remaining broccoli, chickpeas, Brussels sprouts, sweet potato, and tofu on the baking sheet in individual piles.
Drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and chili powder.
Bake for 25 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the tofu is browned.
In a large mason jar, combine the hummus, lemon juice, olive oil, thyme, salt, pepper, and water.
Stir to combine.
Add the reserved raw broccoli, the roasted broccoli, chickpeas, Brussels sprouts, sweet potato, tofu, and spinach and screw on the lid.
Store in the refrigerator until ready to eat, up to 5 days.
Give the mason jar a good shake to mix and use a fork or spoon to stir as needed.
Enjoy!
