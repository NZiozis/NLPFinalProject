Preheat the oven to 160°C (325°F).
Melt the sugar and butter together in a pan on a low-medium heat.
Turn off the heat and stir in the chocolate until melted.
Stir in the eggs and then the flour.
Stir in a bag of McVitie's Nibbles.
Pour the mixture into a 20 cm (8-inch) square brownie tray and bake for 10-15 minutes until the top is just beginning to set.
While these are cooking, make the cheesecake topping. Whisk together the cream cheese and sugar.
Whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract.
Pour this mixture on top of the part-baked brownies.
Top with another bag of McVitie's Nibbles. Bake for another 30-35 minutes.
Allow to cool in the fridge for at least 2 hours, then chop into bites.
Enjoy!
