In a blender, combine the mango, ½ cup (60 g) raspberries, the rosé, lemon-lime soda, and triple sec and blend until smooth.
Place 2 raspberries in each ice pop mold.
Pour the mixture into the ice pop molds, seal with the lids, and add the ice pop sticks.
Freeze until solid, at least 4 hours, or overnight.
Carefully remove the ice pops from the molds.
Enjoy!
