In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt until a dough forms.
Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured surface and flatten into an 8-inch (20 cm) disk.
Cut the disk into 4 equal parts and flatten each part to about Â¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
Very carefully transfer the dough pieces to a nonstick pan preheated over medium heat.
Cook each side of the flatbread until well browned.
Enjoy!
