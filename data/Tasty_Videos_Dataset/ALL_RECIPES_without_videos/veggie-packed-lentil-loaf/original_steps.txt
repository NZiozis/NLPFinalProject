To make the flax eggs, combine the flax meal and water in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside for at least 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
In a large saucepan, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the carrot and celery and cook until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes.
Add the onion and mushrooms. Cook another 3-4 minutes, until the onions are semi-translucent.
Add another drizzle of olive oil to the pan, then add the garlic, bell pepper, and tomato paste. Cook for 2 more minutes, until the tomato paste is slightly browned.
Add the salt, pepper, parsley, and thyme, and cook for 1 more minute, until fragrant.
Add the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce and cook for 2 more minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Remove the pan from the heat.
In a food processor, add the lentils, brown rice, oats, flax eggs, and sautéed vegetables. Pulse 10-12 times until the mixture is slightly chunky.
Transfer the mixture to a parchment paper-lined loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
To make the glaze, combine the ketchup and maple syrup in a small bowl. Brush half of glaze on top of loaf, reserving the other half for later.
Bake the loaf for 45-50 minutes, or until an fork inserted in the middle comes out clean.
Brush with the remaining glaze, then slice and serve.
Enjoy!
