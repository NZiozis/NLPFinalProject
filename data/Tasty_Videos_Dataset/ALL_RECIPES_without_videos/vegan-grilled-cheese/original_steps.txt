In a medium pot, bring 4 cups (960 ml) of water to a boil. Add the cashews and carrot and boil for 10 minutes, or until the carrot is fork tender.
Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cashews and carrot to a high-speed blender. Do not discard the cooking water.
To the blender, add the nutritional yeast, tapioca starch, lemon juice, salt, garlic powder, turmeric, and 1 cup ( 240 ml) plus 2 tablespoons of reserved cooking water (discard any remaining water). Blend the sauce for 2-3 minutes on high speed, until completely smooth.
Pour the “cheese” sauce back into the pot and stir with a spatula over low heat. Clumps should begin to form. Continue stirring for 2-4 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened and stretchy. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside.
Butter each slice of bread on 1 side. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat a dollop of vegan butter over medium heat. Once the butter begins to bubble, add a slice of bread, butter side down, and use a spatula to spread cheese sauce on top. Top with another slice of bread, butter side up. Cook for 2-4 minutes, or until the bottom of the bread is golden brown. Flip and cook for 2-4 minutes more, until the other slice of bread is golden brown as well, then remove from pan. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Slice the sandwiches in half and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
