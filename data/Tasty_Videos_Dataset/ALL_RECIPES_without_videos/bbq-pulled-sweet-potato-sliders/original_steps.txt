On a cutting board, use a box grater to shred the sweet potato.
Heat a large pan with oil over medium heat. Add the sweet potatoes to the hot pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 2-3 minutes.
Add the onions to the pan with the shredded sweet potatoes, and cook until golden brown for about 2-3 minutes.
Add the BBQ sauce, salt, and pepper to the sweet potatoes and onions, and stir until fully incorporated. Cook for 3-5 minutes until browned.
Add the red cabbage, carrots, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper to a bowl and stir to combine. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Add the Greek yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, dill, salt, and pepper to a small bowl and mix to combine. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Add the Greek yogurt sauce onto the bun, top with the BBQ sweet potatoes and slaw.
Enjoy!
