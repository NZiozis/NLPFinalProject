Drain and rinse the jackfruit, then cut into smaller pieces, removing the core.
In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 4-5 minutes, until semi-translucent.
Add the garlic, salt, and pepper, and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant. Add the jackfruit, chili powder, paprika, cumin, and liquid smoke, and mix well. Add the vegetable broth, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, until the jackfruit is soft enough to be mashed.
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mash the jackfruit with potato masher or a couple of forks, until it looks pulled or shredded.
Transfer the jackfruit to the baking sheet and spread in an even layer.
Bake for 25 minutes, until the jackfruit is slightly browned and crispy.
Make the coleslaw: add green and red cabbage and carrots to a large bowl. In a small liquid measuring cup, combine the mayo, mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper, and mix until creamy. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss the coleslaw until the dressing is well-distributed. Set aside.
Remove the jackfruit from the oven, and pour the BBQ sauce over. Mix well.
Return to the oven, and bake for another 10 minutes, until the edges are slightly crispy.
Use a large bread knife to cut the whole sheet of slider buns in half. Remove the top and set aside. Spread the BBQ jackfruit on the bottom half of the buns, then top with coleslaw.
Add the top buns, then slice into 12 sliders.
Enjoy!
