Cut sweet potato into thin slices, about Â¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
Place in toaster and set it to the maximum cook time.
When it pops, flip the sweet potato slices over and toast 1 more time.
Depending on the strength of your toaster and your preferences, you may need to toast it 1 more time after that.
Remove from toaster and let cool enough to handle.
Spread chicken salad evenly across sweet potato toast.
Garnish with green onion.
Enjoy!
