Lay your pizza dough flat on your work surface.
Spread softened butter all over the dough, then sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.
Roll up the dough, split down the middle, and twist one half over the other with the layers exposed.
Twist and join the dough into a circle.
Place on parchment paper, brush on egg wash, and sprinkle more sugar on top.
Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 40 to 45 minutes.
Let the braid cool for a bit before dusting with powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
