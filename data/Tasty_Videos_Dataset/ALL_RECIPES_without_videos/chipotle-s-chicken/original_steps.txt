On a cutting board, season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.
Transfer the chicken to a large zip-top bag with the chopped chipotles and mix until the chicken is fully coated.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to overnight.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the chicken and cook until golden brown, 4 minutes per side.
Remove the chicken with tongs and place on a cutting board. Let cool for 5 minutes. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.
Transfer the chicken back to the pan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes, until all pieces are browned.
Enjoy!
