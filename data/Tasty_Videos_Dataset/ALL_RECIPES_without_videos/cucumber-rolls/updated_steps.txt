In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, smoked salmon, dill, garlic powder, and black pepper.
Using a vegetable peeler or mandoline, peel the cucumbers lengthwise into thin slices.
Discard the outer peel.
Pat the peeled cucumber slices with paper towels to absorb any excess moisture.
Spread a small spoonful of filling over a cucumber slice.
Starting from one end, tightly roll the cucumber into a spiral.
Repeat with remaining cucumber slices and filling.
Enjoy!
