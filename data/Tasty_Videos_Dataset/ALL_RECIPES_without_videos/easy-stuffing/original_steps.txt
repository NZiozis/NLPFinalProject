In a large microwave-safe bowl, add the stuffing mix, then pour in the water and melted butter and stir until evenly mixed.
Cover with a kitchen towel and microwave on full power for 2 minutes.
Remove the bowl from the microwave, add the celery and apple, and stir until well mixed.
Cover and microwave for 2 more minutes. Remove the bowl and stir, then cover and microwave for 1 minute more until stuffing is moist and a little crispy on the edges.
Enjoy!
