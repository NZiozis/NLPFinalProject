Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Using a sharp knife, slice off the top and bottom of an acorn squash to create flat surfaces. Slice the squash in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon.
Place the squash halves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle the squash with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Bake for 40 minutes, until the squash is tender and easily pierced with a paring knife.
Then heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Toss in the onion, carrot, celery, salt, pepper, and rosemary and sauté until the vegetables are completely tender, about 8 minutes.
Sprinkle in the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour in the turkey leftovers and stir the mixture so that everything is evenly mixed.
Pour the mixture into a large bowl and let it cool about 5 minutes.
Crack in the eggs and mix so that everything is evenly coated.
Spoon the turkey mixture into the squash halves.
Bake for 20 minutes, until the turkey mixture has browned slightly.
Serve and enjoy!
