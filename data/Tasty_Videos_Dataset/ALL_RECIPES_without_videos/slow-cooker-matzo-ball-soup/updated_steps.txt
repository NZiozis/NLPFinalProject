Add all ingredients for the soup in the slow cooker and cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours.
In the medium bowl, combine all ingredients for matzo balls.
Mix well and refrigerate for 30 minutes to let the matzo absorb the liquid.
Make matzo mixture into balls and set aside or in the fridge until the soup is done.
Shred the chicken and place back into soup.
Add the balls into the soup and cook for 30 minutes.
Top it with dill or your choice of topping, as desired.
Enjoy!
