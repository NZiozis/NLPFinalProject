Place the apples, cinnamon sticks, ginger, cloves, and salt in an 8-quart (7.5-liters) slow cooker.
Pour the water over the apples.
Cover and cook on high for at least 8 hours, or overnight (up to 24 hours).
Remove the solids from the cider, pressing the pulp to extract as much liquid as possible.
Whisk in the brown sugar until dissolved.
Serve hot, or store in the refrigerator to serve later.
Reheat before serving.
Enjoy!
