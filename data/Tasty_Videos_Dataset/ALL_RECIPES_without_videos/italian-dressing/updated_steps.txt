Add garlic, oregano, parsley, basil, salt, pepper, white wine vinegar, and olive oil into a mason jar and secure lid tightly.
Shake vigorously until ingredients are mixed thoroughly.
Store dressing in the fridge and use within 1-2 weeks.
You may need to shake up the ingredients again before each use.
Enjoy!
