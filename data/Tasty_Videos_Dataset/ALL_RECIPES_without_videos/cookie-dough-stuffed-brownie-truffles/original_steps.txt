Flip the prepared brownies onto a cutting board. Using a rolling pin, roll out the brownies to about ¼-inch (6.5 mm) thickness. Cut into 16 equal squares.
On a small baking sheet, bake the flour at 350˚F (180˚C) for 5 minute to kill potential bacteria.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, butter, milk, vanilla, salt, and chocolate chips. Mix well and freeze for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Form the cookie dough into 16 equal balls, about 1 teaspoon each.
Wrap a brownie square around each ball of cookie dough.
Dip the wrapped truffles in the melted chocolate, covering the entire ball. Chill for 30 minutes, or until ready to serve.
Enjoy!
