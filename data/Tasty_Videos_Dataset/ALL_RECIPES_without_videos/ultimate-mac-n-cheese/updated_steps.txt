Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a large pot over medium heat, cook the bacon crispy and the fat has rendered.
Add the garlic, bread crumbs, chives, and parsley.
Stir and cook until the bread crumbs are toasted, about 5 minutes.
Remove from the pot.
In the same pot on medium heat, melt the butter.
Sprinkle in the flour and stir until combined.
Add the evaporated milk and bring to a simmer.
Season with salt, pepper, mustard powder, and cayenne.
Whisk to incorporate and smooth any lumps.
The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon.
Add the pasta to the sauce and stir to combine.
Add the cheddar, Gruyère, Colby Jack, Gouda, and provolone cheese, then fold the cheeses into the pasta.
If it seems too dry, add more milk to your liking.
Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and top with the shredded mozzarella and cheddar.
Bake for 45 minutes, or until the mac ‘n’ cheese is bubbly, melted, and golden brown on top.
Serve with a sprinkle of the bread crumb mixture for added flavor!
Enjoy!
