Add the rice to a large nonreactive bowl that holds at least double the volume of the rice. Cover the rice by 2-3 inches (5- 7 ½ cm) with warm water and soak for 2 hours.
Drain the rice and transfer to a steamer basket lined with cheesecloth. Set the steamer basket over a large pot with several inches of boiling water.
Cover and steam the rice for 30 minutes, or until shiny and tender. Be careful that the pot doesn’t run dry during steaming; add more water if necessary.
While the rice steams, pour the coconut milk into a large heavy pot over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Make sure it does not boil.
Once the coconut milk is simmering, add the sugar, curry powder, lime zest, and salt, and whisk to completely dissolve the sugar and salt in the hot coconut milk.
When the sticky rice is done, turn it out into a large dish and use a wooden spoon to mix in the coconut milk mixture. Let stand, covered, for 30 minutes-1 hour to allow the flavors to melt.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Season the short ribs all over with salt and pepper.
Heat the canola oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Working in batches, sear the short ribs on all sides until golden brown, 5-6 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside.
To the Dutch oven, add the jalapeño, bay leaves, thyme, and parsley, and cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes.
Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, then add the beef stock and orange juice.
Return the short ribs back to the pan. Cover and braise in the oven for 3 hours, until the meat pulls apart easily with a fork. Set aside to cool slightly, then shred the short ribs with 2 forks.
Using a 3-inch square mold, add a scoop of rice to the mold and spread in an even layer. Scoop in a layer of short rib, then cover with more rice. Garnish with sesame seeds. Unmold the rice and repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Serve with lime wedges.
Enjoy!
