Place the strawberries in a blender and blend until pureed.
Add the vanilla extract, coconut oil, and softened cream cheese, and blend until the texture is silky smooth.
Line a 12-cup muffin with liners (we used silicone liners) or grease with coconut oil. Divide the mixture between the cups.
Freeze for 2 hours or until solid.
Store in the freezer.
Enjoy!
