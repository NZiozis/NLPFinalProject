Preheat the oven to 500ºF (260ºC).
Make the crust: In a large microwave-safe bowl, microwave the hash browns on high power for 5-6 minutes, until you can separate the shredded potato pieces with your fingers but they still hold their shape.
Transfer the shredded potatoes to a clean dish towel set over a medium bowl.
Wring the towel to squeeze any excess liquid from the potatoes.
Add the drained potatoes to a large bowl with the eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and oregano and stir until everything is well incorporated.
The mixture should look like mashed potatoes, with a few shredded potato pieces remaining.
Line a 12-inch (30 cm) round pizza pan with parchment paper.
Transfer the potato mixture to the pan and shape it into a crust, pressing down so that it’s an even thickness with a lip around the outer edge.
Brush the entire crust with olive oil.
Bake for 22-25 minutes, until the crust is beginning to brown and is firm to the touch.
Remove from the oven.
Reduce the oven temperature to 325ºF (160ºC).
Add the toppings: Scatter the Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the crust.
Top with the breakfast sausage.
Carefully add the eggs, spacing evenly around the pizza.
Season the eggs with salt and pepper.
Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still a bit runny.
Top with the scallions and hot sauce, if using, then slice into wedges.
Enjoy!
