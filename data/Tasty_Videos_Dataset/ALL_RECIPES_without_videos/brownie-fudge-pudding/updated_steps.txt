Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180°C).
Whisk the brown sugar and butter in a bowl.
Whisk in the egg and vanilla.
Fold in the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Divide the batter between 4 ramekins, or any other oven-proof pots you may have lying around in the kitchen.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked but still fudgey inside.
Serve with whipped cream.
Enjoy!
