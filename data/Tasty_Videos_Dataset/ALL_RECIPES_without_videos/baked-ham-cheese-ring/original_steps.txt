Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Unroll cans of dough, separate into triangles.
On a large cookie sheet, place a bowl in the center (about 5 inches [12cm] in diameter). Arrange the triangles in a ring around the bowl, dough should overlap.
Layer cheese, pepperoncinis, basil, salami, ham, prosciutto, and provolone on each triangle closest to the ring.
Season with salt and pepper.
Bring the top of the triangle over the filling, and tuck the edges under the bottom layer of dough. Repeat around the ring until the entire filling is enclosed.
Bake for 30 minutes or until the dough is golden brown.
Serve with olive oil and balsamic.
Cool 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into serving slices.
Enjoy!
