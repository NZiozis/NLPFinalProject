Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Prepare your favorite type of brownie batter or use a boxed variety.
Transfer the batter to a greased 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
Sprinkle in the chopped leftover candy and place in the oven to bake for 25 minutes or until cooked through.
Let cool completely.
To the warmed heavy cream, add a package of gelatin and allow it to bloom for 1-3 minutes.
To a large bowl, add the cream cheese, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, pumpkin puree, warm cream with gelatin.
Stir to combine.
Pour the mixture over the brownies and let cool in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or until set.
Slice the brownies, drizzle with chocolate syrup, and serve.
Enjoy!
