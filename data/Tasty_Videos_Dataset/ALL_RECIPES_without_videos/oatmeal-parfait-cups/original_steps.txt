Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C.
In a medium bowl, mash the bananas into a paste.
Pour in the honey and almond extract, and mix until well combined.
Sprinkle on the rolled oats and cinnamon and mix until incorporated.
Evenly divide the oats into a greased 12-cup muffin tin.
Use your fingers to mold the oats into a cup shape in each of the muffin cups.
Bake for 15 minutes, until the oatmeal cups have set.
Remove the oatmeal cups from the muffin tin and place them on a serving plate.
Place a spoonful of yogurt in each cup and top with your choice of toppings.
Enjoy!
