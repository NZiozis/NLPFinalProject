Add the shrimp to a mesh strainer set in a bowl of cool water and let sit for about 10 minutes to defrost.
In a medium bowl, combine the defrosted shrimp, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and lemon zest.
Toss until the shrimp are well coated.
Heat a medium pan over medium heat.
Add the shrimp to the pan and cook for about 1 minute on each side, until pink, opaque, and firm.
Remove from the pan and set aside to cool.
Make the vinaigrette: In a liquid measuring cup, combine the shallot, vinegar, honey, mustard, salt, and pepper.
Whisk until fully incorporated.
While whisking, slowly stream in the olive oil until completely emulsified.
To assemble the salad, add the mesclun greens to a large bowl.
Top with the cooked shrimp, quinoa, cherry tomatoes, avocado, chickpeas, and green onions.
Drizzle with the vinaigrette, then toss to combine.
Enjoy!
