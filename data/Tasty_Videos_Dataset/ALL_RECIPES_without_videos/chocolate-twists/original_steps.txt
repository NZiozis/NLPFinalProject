Cut the puff pastry sheet into quarters.
Use a spatula to spread ⅛ cup (35 g) of chocolate hazelnut spread over a square, then roll it up.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Slice the roll in half lengthwise. Braid the halves around each other and use egg wash to seal the ends.
Transfer the twists to the prepared baking sheet and brush with egg wash.
Bake for 14 minutes, or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
