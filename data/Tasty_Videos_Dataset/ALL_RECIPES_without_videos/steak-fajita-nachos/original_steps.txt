Preheat oven to 350F°/175°C.
Mix the steak, salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, and cumin in a bowl until evenly coated.
Heat oil in a pan over very high heat, until barely smoking. Fry the steak for 30 seconds on each side, then rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes.
Slice the steak into bite-size pieces.
In a large pan or skillet, lay down half of the tortilla chips, followed by half of the steak, peppers, onions, pepper jack, and cheddar. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
