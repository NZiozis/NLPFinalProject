Remove the stem from each sprout and cut in half.
Place the brussels sprouts in a large bowl.
Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl and toss to cover.
Spread the sprouts onto a baking sheet.
Bake in a 400˚F (200˚C) oven for 20 minutes.
Flip the sprouts, then bake for an additional 20 minutes or until the sprouts are fork-tender and golden.
Enjoy!
