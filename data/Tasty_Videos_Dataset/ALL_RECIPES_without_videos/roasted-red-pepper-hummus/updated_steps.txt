Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Place the peppers on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes, until peppers are fragrant and the skin has charred.
Allow peppers to cool before peeling away the charred skin.
Add roasted peppers, chickpeas, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper to the bowl of a 2-quart food processor.
Blend until smooth.
While blending, slowly add in the olive oil until hummus is creamy and smooth.
Garnish with finely chopped bell pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.
Enjoy!
