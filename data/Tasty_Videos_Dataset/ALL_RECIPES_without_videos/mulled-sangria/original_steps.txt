In a large pot over medium-low heat or a slow cooker, combine the simple syrup, star anise, cinnamon sticks, brandy, orange juice, orange, lemon, lime, and red wine.
Stir well, cover, and simmer over low heat for at least 20 minutes, until warmed through.
Ladle the sangria into mugs and garnish with lime wedges.
Enjoy!
