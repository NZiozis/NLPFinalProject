In a small mixing bowl combine flour, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, cayenne, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix until evenly distributed.
Place the sliced pickles in the flour, then egg wash, and then bread crumbs.
Preheat oil to 350˚F (120˚C) in a pot.
Fry the pickles for 3-5 minutes, or until browned and crispy on the outside.
For the ranch dressing, combine buttermilk, mayonnaise, sour cream, onion powder, garlic powder, dill, parsley, salt, and pepper in a small mixing bowl and stir until well combined.
Use a toothpick to assemble the sliders with fried pickles, the ranch dressing, a meatball, lettuce, tomato, and one more pickle.
Enjoy!
