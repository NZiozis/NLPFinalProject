Peel off the shrimp skin (leave the tail on) and salt and pepper the shrimp for seasoning.
Cook the potatoes, mash them into small crumbs and add in butter and egg yolk. (If the texture is too wet, go ahead and add in some flour.)
Mix until smooth and then add in salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for seasoning, mix well.
Take about ⅓ cup mashed potato, form into a ball shape, poke a hole on the top, then put a shrimp inside, cover the shrimp well, and tighten the ball.
Dip the ball into flour, egg wash, and panko, and make sure the ball is fully covered well with all three ingredients. If needed, refrigerate the balls before frying.
Heat the oil between 350ºF to 375ºF (180ºC to 190ºC), then fry the shrimp ball until the outside is golden brown.
Let it cool down a bit, and then serve it right away with any kind of sauce.
Enjoy!
