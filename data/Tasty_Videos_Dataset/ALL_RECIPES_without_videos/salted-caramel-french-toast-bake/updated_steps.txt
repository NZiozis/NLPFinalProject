Preheat oven to /350˚F (180°C).
In a small saucepan, add the sugar and water, carefully swirling the pan to make sure the water is covering all the sugar.
Cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until a deep amber colour, without stirring.
Turn off the heat and add the double cream, whisking until smooth.
Stir in the salt and cool.
In a large bowl, add the eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and most of the cooled salted caramel sauce and whisk until smooth.
Placed the chopped white bread into a greased heatproof dish and pour over the egg mixture.
Sprinkle over chopped pecans and bake for 45 minutes.
(If the top of the bread is burning, cover with foil halfway through baking.)
Serve with icing sugar and leftover salted caramel sauce.
Enjoy!
