In a medium pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering, then cook the garlic until fragrant, for 1-2 minutes.
Stir in the crushed tomato, paprika, chili powder, ground cumin, salt, and pepper.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
Set aside to cool.
In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, oregano, rice, and 1 cup (260 G) of tomato sauce.
Mix until combined.
Refrigerate until ready to use.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.
Add the cabbage, cut side down.
Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) for 45 minutes.
Transfer the cabbage to a cutting board, cut side up, and let cool until it reaches room temperature.
Peel off a layer of the cabbage.
With the stem facing upwards, use a paring knife to trim the thicker stem, which will make the leaf easier to roll.
With the stem side pointed towards you, place a few tablespoons of filling at the base of the leaf.
Roll upwards so the filling is covered by a single layer of the cabbage.
Fold both sides in, then roll all the way up.
Place the cabbage roll seam side down in a 9x13-inch (23x33 -cm) baking dish and repeat with the remaining filling.
Spoon the remaining tomato sauce over the cabbage rolls.
Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
Enjoy!
