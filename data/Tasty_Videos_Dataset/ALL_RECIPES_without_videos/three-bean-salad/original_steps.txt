Thinly slice the red onion and add to a large bowl.
Quarter the cucumber, remove the seeds and dice, then add to the bowl with the red onion.
Use a fork to remove the leaves from the parsley, then finely chop and add to the bowl.
Add the chickpeas, kidney beans, and cannellini beans to the bowl.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper, and whisk together.
Pour the dressing over the salad and mix well until evenly distributed.
Enjoy!
