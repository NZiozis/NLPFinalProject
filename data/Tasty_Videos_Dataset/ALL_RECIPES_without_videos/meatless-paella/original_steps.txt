Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the onion and cook until translucent, 3-4 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook for about 2 minutes until it is fragrant.
Add the yellow bell peppers, red bell peppers, and green beans. Cook stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes until tender.
Add the rice, smoked paprika, sweet paprika, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Stir until incorporated. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the rice starts to sizzle.
Add the canned tomatoes. Cook for 5 minutes until the liquid has evaporated slightly.
Add the vegetable broth, saffron threads (crush the saffron threads between your fingertips), and bay leaves. Bring to a boil on high heat. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed by the rice, about 10 minutes.
Add in the peas, artichokes, and sausage, if using. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 10 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and let sit covered for 10 minutes.
Sprinkle the fresh parsley.
Enjoy!
