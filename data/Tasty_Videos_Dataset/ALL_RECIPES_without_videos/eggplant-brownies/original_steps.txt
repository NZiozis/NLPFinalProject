Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Peel the eggplant, then cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds, then chop into large pieces. Transfer to a steamer basket set over a large pot of simmering water, cover, and steam for 20 minutes, until the eggplant is very soft.
Transfer the hot eggplant to the bowl of the food processor with 4 ounces (110 g) of semisweet chocolate chips, the unsweetened chocolate, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. The heat from the eggplant will melt the chocolate. Blend on high speed for 2-3 minutes, until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, then add the almond flour, cocoa powder, and salt, and whisk to combine. Add the eggplant chocolate mixture and fold with a rubber spatula to combine. Fold in the remaining semisweet chocolate chips.
Transfer the batter to a greased 8-inch (20-cm) square baking dish and smooth the top. Top with more chocolate chips, if desired.
Bake for 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownies comes out clean.
Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing.
Enjoy!
