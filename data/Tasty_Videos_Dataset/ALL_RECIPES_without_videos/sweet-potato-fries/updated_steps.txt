Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC.
Slice the ends off of the sweet potato and then slice it in half.
Take one half and slice it horizontally 4 times then slice vertically 4 times to cut into fries.
In a large bowl mix fries and ingredients until evenly spread.
Place fries on a prepared baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes or until fluffy inside and crunchy on the outside.
Enjoy!
