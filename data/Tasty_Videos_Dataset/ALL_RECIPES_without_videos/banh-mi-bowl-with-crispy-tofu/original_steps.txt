Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Wrap tofu in an absorbent towel. Set cast-iron skillet or other heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes to remove extra moisture.
Unwrap tofu and cut into small cubes. Transfer to a baking sheet and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the tofu is firm to the touch and golden brown.
In a medium bowl, add soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger. Stir to combine.
Spiralize the cucumber and carrots into a large bowl.
Transfer veggies to a bowl and assemble with tofu, brown rice, cilantro, green onions, red cabbage, radishes, mint, jalapeños, and sauce.
Enjoy!
