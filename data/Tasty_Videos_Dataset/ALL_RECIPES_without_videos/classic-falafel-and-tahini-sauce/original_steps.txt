Soak the chickpeas in the water for at least one night, ensuring that the chickpeas are fully submerged.
Drain the chickpeas in a colander. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and add the chickpeas. Cover with more paper towels and let dry for at least 2 hours.
Add the dried chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, coriander, mint, 5 cloves of garlic, onion, paprika, 2 teaspoons of cumin, ground coriander, baking soda, toasted sesame seeds, salt, and pepper, in a blender and blend until smooth.
Use your hands to form falafel the size of a ping pong ball.
Heat oil to 320°F (160°C) in a large pot.
Add the falafel in batches, and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
To make tahini sauce, heat the sesame seeds in a frying pan over medium heat until the seeds brown slightly.
Let cool for about 5 minutes and pour into a small blender or coffee grinder.
Add the sesame oil and half of the olive oil and blend. Add the rest of the olive oil and blend again until you get a smooth mixture.
Add ¼ teaspoon of cumin, 2 garlic cloves and lemon juice and blend.
Serve the tahini sauce with falafel.
Enjoy!
