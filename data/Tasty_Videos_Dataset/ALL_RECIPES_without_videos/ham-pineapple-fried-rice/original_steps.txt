In a wok or deep skillet, heat up the oil over high heat and cook onion, garlic, carrots, bell peppers, and ham until onions are translucent and ham is slightly browned. Push all of the cooked ham and vegetables to the side of the pan.
Beat the eggs and pour into the cleared half of the pan. Scramble the eggs and mix with the rest of the vegetables.
Add rice, soy sauce, pepper, and pineapple. Mix well and let the rice cook until slightly crispy.
Enjoy!
