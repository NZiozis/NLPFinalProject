In a medium bowl, soak raw hazelnuts in 2 cups (475 ml) of water overnight.
Drain the bowl of water and place the hazelnuts in a blender.
Add 1 tablespoon vanilla, 2 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons unsweetened cacao powder, 1 pinch of salt, and 4 cups (945 ml) of water to the blender.
Blend the mixture on high for 90 seconds.
Use a cheesecloth to strain the liquid into a pouring container.
(Optional) refrigerate 1-2 hours or serve immediately.
Enjoy!
