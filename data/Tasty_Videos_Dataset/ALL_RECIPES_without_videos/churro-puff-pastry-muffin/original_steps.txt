Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Cut the puff pastry sheets in half, then use a rolling pin to roll each half out to 24 inches long x 8 inches wide.
Brush the puff pastry sheets with the softened butter, then carefully roll them up into tight logs. Cut the logs in half lengthwise.
Take each half and fold the smooth part of the dough inward to create a spiral shape.
Place the spirals in a muffin tin and brush the tops with egg wash.
Bake for 15 minutes on the top rack, then transfer to the bottom rack and bake for another 15 minutes.
Combine the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.
Remove the muffins from the oven. Once cool enough to handle, roll in the cinnamon sugar mixture.
Enjoy!
