Preheat the oven to 325˚F (170˚C).
Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Add the cashews to a food processor and pulse until finely ground.
Add the oat flour, salt, maple syrup, milk, and vanilla to the food processor and blend until fully combined and the crust becomes very sticky and clumps together.
Transfer the crust to the prepared baking sheet and use your hands to form it into the shape of a pizza, about ¼-inch (6 mm) thick.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the edges of the crust are just starting to turn golden brown.
Let the crust cool completely, then chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
In a medium bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla.
Top the crust with the Greek yogurt mixture and spread evenly with a rubber spatula.
Top with sliced fruit and sprinkle with lemon zest, if using.
Slice with a knife or pizza cutter, then serve.
Enjoy!
