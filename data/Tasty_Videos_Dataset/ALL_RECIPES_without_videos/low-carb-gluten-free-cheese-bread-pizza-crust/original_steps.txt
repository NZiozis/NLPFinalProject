Melt ¾ cup (75 g) mozzarella and cream cheese together in the microwave for 1 minute, stirring every 20 seconds, or until fully melted.
Combine almond (or coconut) flour, baking powder, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and egg. Mix well, then stir in the melted mozzarella until fully incorporated. Shape into a ball, cover, and chill for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Place chilled dough on a floured piece of parchment paper. Roll out into a circle about ¼- to ½-inch (6 to 13-mm) thick. Bake for 10 minutes, just until it starts to get golden brown.
Top with tomato sauce, remaining mozzarella, and pepperoni, then bake again for another 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted.
Enjoy!
