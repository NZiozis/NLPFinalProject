Add the watermelon, cucumber, bell pepper, jalapeño, mint, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper to a food processor or blender..
While blending, slowly add the olive oil and continue blending until the mixture has reached your desired consistency.
Transfer the soup to a large bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight, to allow the flavors to deepen.
Serve the soup chilled and garnish with a slice of cucumber, a slice of jalapeño, and a sprig of mint.
Enjoy!
