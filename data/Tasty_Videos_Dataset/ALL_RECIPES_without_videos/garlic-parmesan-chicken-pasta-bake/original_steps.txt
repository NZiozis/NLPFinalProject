Melt butter, add garlic, thyme, sage and rosemary. Sauté until fragrant. Remove the thyme, sage and rosemary.
Add flour and stir.
Add the milk, a little bit at a time, and whisk after each addition. Repeat until all the milk is gone. Keep whisking until it has thickened and coats the back of a spoon.
Grease a 9×13 inch (22 x33 cm) pan. Cover bottom with a layer of pasta, half of the chicken, half of the peas, a ⅓ of the parmesan, a ⅓ water and ⅓ of the sauce.
Repeat once. Top with noodles, remaining water and cheese.
Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes at 400°F (200°C).
Remove the foil, sprinkle the top with breadcrumbs.
Broil for 5-10 minutes or until golden brown.
Serve with chopped parsley as garnish.
Enjoy!
