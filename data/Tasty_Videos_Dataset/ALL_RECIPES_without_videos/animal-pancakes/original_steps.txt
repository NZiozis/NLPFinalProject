Prepare pancake mix per box instructions.
Heat a nonstick pan or pancake griddle on medium heat. For large pancakes, pour 1 cup (235 ml) of batter onto the pan. For small pancakes, pour a little less than ¼ cup (60 ml) of batter onto the pan. For medium pancakes, pour ⅓ cup (80 ml) of batter onto the pan.
Allow to cook until bubbles form and begin to pop all around the pancake. The pancake will also lose its shiny sheen and begin to look more matte. Flip and cook on the other side for 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom is lightly browned.
