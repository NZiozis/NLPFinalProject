Peel the lemons with a peeler, making sure to avoid the white pith, which would make the oil bitter.
Add the peels to a medium pot filled with the olive oil and stir.
Let simmer over very low heat for 15-20 minutes.
Strain out the peels.
Transfer the infused oil to a bottle or other resealable container.
The oil will keep in the fridge for a few weeks. If you see any signs of spoilage, discard it.
Enjoy!
