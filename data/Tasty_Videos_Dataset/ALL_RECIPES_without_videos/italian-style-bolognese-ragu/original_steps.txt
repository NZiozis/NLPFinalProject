Heat olive oil and butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta. Cook for around 10 minutes until the onions start to look translucent.
Add the minced meats and brown all over, ensure the meat is fully broken up and no large chunks remain.
Add salt and pepper to taste. Increase the heat, add the wine, and allow to evaporate for around 2-3 minutes.
In a large jug, dilute the tomato puree into the chicken stock and add to the pan, stir well.
Reduce to a low heat, then cover and simmer for 2 hours. Check from time to time to ensure the sauce is not drying out. If this occurs, add a small amount of stock.
Cook desired pasta and toss in the bolognese.
Top with parmesan cheese and serve.
Enjoy!
