Preheat oven to 400°F (220°C)
Unfold the puff pastry.
Spread the chocolate hazelnut spread onto the middle third.
Arrange the sliced bananas on top of the spread in a single layer.
Bananas may slightly overlap.
Cut out a triangle of the top right corner of the pastry.
Repeat on the other side.
Cut diagonal slits along both sides of the pastry.
Each will be around 1 inch (2 ½ cm) thick.
Fold over the top piece of dough to partially cover the top row of bananas.
Alternating both sides, fold the strips of pastry over the bananas, mimicking a braid pattern.
Trim the excess dough on the sides, and fold over the bottom flap.
Brush the top of the braided pastry with the beaten egg.
Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet for and bake 15 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.
Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
Enjoy!
