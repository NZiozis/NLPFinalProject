Spread the bananas on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours.
Blend the frozen banana slices in a high-speed blender until they reach a smooth consistency.
Add the vanilla and peanut butter and blend to combine.
Transfer to a bowl or container and freeze for 1 hour, or until ready to serve.
