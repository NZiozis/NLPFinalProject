In a medium wok or skillet over medium heat, add the sesame oil and onion, and cook 3 minutes, until onions are translucent.

Add the marinated tofu to the pan and cook until the majority of marinade cooks off.
Add the water chestnuts and scallions.
Pour in the reserved sauce.
Toss to coat and cook until just heated through.
Transfer the tofu mixture to a medium bowl.
Heat the canola oil in the same pan over high heat until a drop of water sizzles when flicked onto the oil.
Fry the rice noodles for about 30 seconds, until puffed up.
Transfer the fried noodles to paper towels to drain.
