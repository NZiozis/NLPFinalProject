Place graham crackers in a zipper storage bag and crush with a rolling pin until the cookies are fully crushed.
Transfer the graham cracker crumbs to a bowl, and add in the sugar, cinnamon, and salt, stirring to combine. Add in the melted butter and mix well.
In a buttered 6-inch (15 cm) springform pan, add the graham cracker mixture and press firmly to form an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
In a medium size bowl, combine softened ice cream, half of the marshmallows, and chocolate chips.
Pour over the graham cracker crust and freeze over night.
Microwave the chocolate and heavy cream together in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the glaze is smooth and glossy.
Pour the ganache over the ice cream cake. Freeze for 30 minutes.
In a medium bowl, combine rum and remaining half of the marshmallows. Let sit for 15 minutes.
Pour the marshmallows over the ice cream cake. Using a torch, brown the marshmallows on top of the cake.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
