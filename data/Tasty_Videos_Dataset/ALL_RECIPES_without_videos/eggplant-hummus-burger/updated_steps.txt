Combine chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, tahini, cumin, and salt in a blender and blend until smooth.
Slice eggplants into four 1-inch (2 Â½ cm) slices.
Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and let sit for 20-30 minutes, then pat dry.
In a small bowl, stir together oil, paprika, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.
Brush each side of the eggplant slices with the oil and spice mixture.
Heat a pan or grill on medium-high heat and cook each eggplant slice for 3-4 minutes per side.
Build your burger with the hummus sandwiched between two eggplant slices.
Enjoy!
