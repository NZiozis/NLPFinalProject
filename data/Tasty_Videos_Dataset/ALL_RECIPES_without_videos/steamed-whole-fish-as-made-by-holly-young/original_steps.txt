Bring a large pan of water to boil and set a steamer basket on top. Place a plate inside the steamer basket.
Peel the ginger with a spoon, then slice. Julienne half and set aside.
Cut the green onions into 2-3 inch (5-7 cm) pieces. Thinly slice half and set aside.
On the plate in the steamer, place the sliced ginger and cut green onions. Place the whole fish on top and cover with the lid. Steam for 8-10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through--check by poking a chopstick through the thickest part of the flesh. Remove the fish from the steamer and transfer to a serving platter.
Make the sauce: In a small bowl, combine the sugar, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well.
Scatter the sliced green onions and julienned ginger over the fish, then pour the hot oil and sauce on top.
Enjoy!
