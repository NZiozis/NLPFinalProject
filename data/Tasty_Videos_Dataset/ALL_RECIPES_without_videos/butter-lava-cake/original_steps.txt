Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
To make the cake batter, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Mix in the egg and vanilla extract. Once incorporated, mix in the milk. Gradually add the flour until the batter becomes thick and dough-like.
To make the filling, use a hand mixer to beat the butter and cream cheese in a separate large bowl. Once fluffy, gradually add the powdered sugar. Mix in the vanilla extract and cream and beat until mixture is smooth and thick.
Grease a 6-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray. Take a golf ball-size portion of cake dough and line the base and sides of a cup. Repeat with the remaining cups.
Fill each cake bowl with ¼ cup (30 g) of filling.
Take another golf ball-size portion of cake dough, roll it in a ball, and flatten with your fingers to create a 2-inch (5-cm) circle. Place the circle over the top of the filling, and press down the edges to make sure it seals to the other dough. Repeat with the remaining cakes.
Bake for 20 minutes until light, golden brown.
Remove from the oven, invert onto a cutting board.
Serve immediately topped with sifted powdered sugar and raspberries.
Enjoy!
