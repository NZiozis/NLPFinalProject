Place the two sheets of puff pastry on a parchment paper lined baking tray.
Cut out equal size circles.
Remove the top sheet.
On the bottom sheet, spread pizza sauce and shredded cheese.
Place the other sheet of puff pastry on top.
Take a glass and place it in the center of the circle.
Using a knife or scissors, cut strips away from the edge of the glass.
Take each strip and twist.
Brush egg wash over the top of the puff pastry.
Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 20-25 minutes.
Enjoy!
