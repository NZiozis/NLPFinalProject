Slice the Italian loaf, cutting slices about an inch (2 cm) in thickness. (Make sure the bread is room temperature for the best taste!)
Place 8 slices of capicola, all stacked on top of each other, on a pan or griddle. Cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes.
Flip the capicola over and add the provolone cheese. Cook until the cheese melts.
Place the capicola and cheese on one slice of bread.
Top with fries, coleslaw, tomato slices, and top with the other slice of bread.
Enjoy!
