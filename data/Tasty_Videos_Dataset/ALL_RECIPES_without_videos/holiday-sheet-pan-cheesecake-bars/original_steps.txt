Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Make the crust: In a large bowl, mix together the crushed graham crackers and melted butter until the mixture resembles wet sand.
Pour onto a baking sheet and press into an even layer. Use a spatula to draw lines in the crust crosswise, dividing it into 4 even sections. Arrange the graham cracker quarters along the lines, then press down the crust around the crackers to secure.
Bake for 8 minutes until lightly browned. Let cool to room temperature.
Reduce the oven temperature to 225°F (105°C).
Make the filling: In a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer on medium speed to whip the cream cheese and sugar until slightly fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time.
Mix in the sour cream and vanilla. Divide the filling evenly between 4 medium bowls.
In the first bowl, mix in the sweet potato puree, ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon, and the nutmeg.
In another bowl, whisk in the chocolate hazelnut spread.
In another bowl, whisk in ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon.
In the last bowl, mix in the pumpkin puree and the pumpkin pie spice.
Pour each flavored filling into a section of the crust and smooth with a spatula.
Scoop the apple pie filling over the cinnamon flavor and swirl into the filling with a skewer.
Drizzle the melted semi-sweet chocolate over the chocolate flavor and swirl into the filling with a skewer.
Sprinkle the chopped pecans over the pumpkin filling.
Bake for 1 hour, until cheesecake is set. Let cool in the oven with the door open.
Refrigerate overnight before slicing into wedges and serving.
Enjoy!
