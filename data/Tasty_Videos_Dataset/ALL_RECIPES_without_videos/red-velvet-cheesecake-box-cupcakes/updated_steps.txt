Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a large bowl, prepare the red velvet cake batter.
In a separate bowl, combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla, stirring until there are no lumps.
Divide the batter evenly among a lined muffin tin, filling halfway.
Spoon some of the cream cheese mixture onto the batter.
Top with remaining batter, filling about ¾ of the way up.
Bake for 20 minutes, then cool.
Pipe the cream cheese frosting onto each cupcake, then top with red velvet crumbs.
Enjoy!
