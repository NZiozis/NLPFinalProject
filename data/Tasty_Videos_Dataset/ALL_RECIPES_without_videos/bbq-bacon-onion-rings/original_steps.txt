Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Peel and cut onions into ½-inch (1 cm) rings. Separate the rings.
Wrap a piece of bacon around one onion ring. Repeat with remaining onion rings and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Combine the BBQ sauce and honey in a bowl, and brush onto rings.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
