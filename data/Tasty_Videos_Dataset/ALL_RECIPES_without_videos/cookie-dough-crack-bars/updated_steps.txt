In a medium bowl, add almond flour, coconut flour, and coconut sugar.
Stir to combine.
Add the nut butter and coconut oil.
Combine until the mixture resembles cookie dough.
Fold in dark chocolate chunks.
Transfer the “cookie dough” into an 8x8-inch (20x20-cm) parchment paper-lined baking dish and mold it with your hands to fit the dish.
Transfer to freezer while making the chocolate layer.
In a microwave safe bowl or measuring cup, melt chocolate and coconut oil and then pour on top of the cookie dough, making sure to spread it evenly across.
Sprinkle with sea salt and freeze.
When ready, slice into squares, and serve.
Try with different combinations.
Enjoy!
