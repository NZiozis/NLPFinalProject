Crush the crisps in a zip top bag with a rolling pin, or just blend them for a few seconds in a food processor.
Add to a small bowl and set aside.
In another small bowl, combine flour, paprika, onion salt, and chives.
In one more separate bowl, beat 2 eggs.
Coat the string cheese in flour first, then egg, then crisps.
Then go back into the egg, and again in the crisps for an extra crispy breading.
Heat a skillet with a bit of oil in the bottom and cook mozzarella sticks for 3 to 5 minutes, turning occasionally to brown all sides.
Sprinkle a pinch of salt and with more dried chives, and serve with sour cream dip!
Enjoy!
