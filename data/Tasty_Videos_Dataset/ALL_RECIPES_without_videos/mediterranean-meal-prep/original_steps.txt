Make the hummus: Add the chickpeas to a food processor with the garlic, paprika, salt, cumin, lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and the water. Pulse until creamy.
Transfer the hummus to a container and top with more olive oil and red pepper flakes. The hummus will keep in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
Make the Mediterranean bowl: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Pour the quinoa into the skillet and toast for 3-4 minutes, or until light golden brown.
Add the vegetable broth, thyme, tarragon, parsley, juice of 1 lemon, and salt and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove the pan from the heat.
Slice the cucumbers, halve the tomatoes, chop the olives, and dice the onion.
Place all of the vegetables in a medium bowl. Add the parsley, remaining tablespoon of olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
To assemble a bowl, add ¼ of the quinoa, ¼ of the vegetables, and ¼ of the hummus to a resealable container. Top the vegetables with crumbled feta.
Store the bowls in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Enjoy!
