Place eggs in a small saucepan.
Add cold water to the pot to completely submerge the eggs.
Bring to a boil, then cover pot with a lid and turn off the heat.
Let eggs sit in the hot water for 14 minutes.
Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water to cool.
Peel the eggs.
Slice eggs in half lengthwise and carefully remove the yolks.
Transfer the yolks to a mixing bowl and set aside the halved egg whites.
Mash the yolks with a fork until crumbly.
Stir in the mayonnaise, vinegar, salt, and Frenchâ€™s Yellow Mustard until the filling is smooth.
Transfer the filling to a piping bag and pipe into the halved egg whites.
Top the deviled eggs with the scallions, bacon, and cheddar cheese, dividing evenly.
Top with freshly ground pepper and serve.
Enjoy!
