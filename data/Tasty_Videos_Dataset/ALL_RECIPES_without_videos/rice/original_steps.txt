Rinse the rice in a sieve three times, or until the water runs clear.
Add the water and salt to a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.
Add the rice and stir, letting the water come to a boil again.
Place the lid on the saucepan and lower the heat to a simmer. Simmer for 18 minutes.
Turn off the heat and let the rice steam for 5 minutes.
Fluff the rice with a fork.
Enjoy!
