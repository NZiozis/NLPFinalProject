In a bowl, add the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, green onions, salt, mustard, garlic, and black pepper, and whisk to combine.
Add the flour, salt, and pepper to a wide, shallow bowl and stir to combine.
Add the egg into another bowl, and whisk until beaten.
Place bread crumbs in a third wide, shallow bowl.
Dip the chicken in the flour, the egg, and then bread crumbs.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken breast and cook until crispy and golden, about 3 minutes per side.
Remove the chicken from the pan and toss in a bowl of buffalo sauce and honey.
Slice the chicken into strips.
Add the spinach, cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumber to a bowl and drizzle with the dressing.
Top with the hot chicken.
Toss to combine.
Enjoy!
