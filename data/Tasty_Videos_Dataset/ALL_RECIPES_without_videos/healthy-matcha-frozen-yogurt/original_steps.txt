Combine ingredients into a food processor or high-speed blender, process until consistently green and smooth.
Pour into a pan and smooth into an even layer.
Freeze for 2 hours, or until frozen but still a little soft for scooping. (If freezing overnight, cover with a lid or plastic wrap, but let it sit out at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes before scooping).
Scoop into a bowl and top with your favorite toppings.
Enjoy!
