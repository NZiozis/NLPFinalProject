Preheat oven to 450ºF (230˚C).
Place the broccoli florets on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive, cayenne, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper, and stir to combine.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, tossing halfway through, until lightly charred.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat.
Add the pasta and cook until al dente.
Before draining through a colander, reserve 1 cup (240 ml) of the pasta water.
Return the pasta to the pot.
Add the hummus, ½ cup (120 ml) of the pasta cooking water, lemon zest, lemon juice, butter, and Parmesan and toss until a creamy sauce forms.
Thin the sauce with more pasta cooking water, a little at a time, as needed.
Add the basil, parsley, red pepper flakes, and remaining reserved water.
Add the broccoli to the pasta, and toss gently with salt, and pepper.
Serve immediately with extra Parmesan, basil and parsley on top.
Enjoy!
