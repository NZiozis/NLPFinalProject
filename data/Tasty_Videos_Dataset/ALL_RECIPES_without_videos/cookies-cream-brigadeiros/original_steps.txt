Separate the cream center from the chocolate cookies, and set aside. Crush the chocolate cookies and set aside.
In a pot over low heat, melt the butter, condensed milk, and cream centers, stirring continuously until you can see the bottom of the pot for 2-3 seconds when dragging a spatula through.
Pour onto a greased plate, then chill for 1 hour.
Shape and roll the chilled mixture into balls.
Roll the balls in the crushed chocolate cookies.
Enjoy!
