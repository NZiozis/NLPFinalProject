On a large plate, arrange the sausage and the ham in a circle, then place a microwaveable mug in the center.
Crack the eggs into the mug, season with salt, pepper, and add a splash of milk.
Stir until evenly mixed.
Microwave the entire plate for about 2 minutes until the egg is cooked through, making sure it does not bubble over.
Remove the plate and microwave the bacon strips on a separate plate for about 4-7 minutes.
Check the bacon at 4 minutes, then every minute or so to make sure it doesn’t burn.
Drain the bacon of its fat, then set aside.
Invert the mug with the egg, then slice the egg cylinder into 5 equal rounds.
You may have to run a knife around the mug first to ensure that the egg comes loose in one solid piece.
To assemble, layer your sandwich as you’d like with the meat, egg, cheese, and spinach.
Wrap each sandwich in a damp paper towel, then with parchment paper.
Place the sandwiches in a large zip top bag, then freeze for up until 1 month.
When ready to eat, remove a sandwich from the freezer, unwrap the parchment, and microwave for about 2 minutes.
Cool for 1 minute, then unwrap the paper towel.
Enjoy!
