Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C).
Using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the cheese, butter, and salt in a large bowl.
Once combined, mix in the flour and add the ice water one tablespoon at a time.
The dough should hold together when pressed but crumble apart if you break it up in your hand.
If it seems too dry, add a little more ice water.
Divide the dough in half and pack together into 2 discs.
Wrap in parchment paper and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Roll out the dough to ¼ inch (6 mm) thick, pinching together the cracks on the edges.
Trace and cut out 6 spoon shapes from each disc of dough.
Place the cut-out cheese spoons on top of greased, upside-down spoons on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Lightly press down to mold the dough to each spoon’s shape.
Bake for 25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Serve with layered taco dip, if desired.
Enjoy!
