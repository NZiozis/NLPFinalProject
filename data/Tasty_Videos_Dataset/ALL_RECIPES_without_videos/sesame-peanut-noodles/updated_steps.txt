In a blender, combine the peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, water, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger and blend until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the spaghetti, carrots, cabbage, and edamame and pour over the peanut sauce.
Use tongs to mix well, until sauce is fully incorporated.
Transfer to bowls and top with peanuts, black sesame seeds, and scallion.
Enjoy!
