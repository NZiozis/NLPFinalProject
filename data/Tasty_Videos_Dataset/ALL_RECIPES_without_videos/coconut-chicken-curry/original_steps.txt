In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken with the onion, scallions, garlic, cilantro, curry powder, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix and let marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat until shimmering, and add the onion and garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
Add the curry powder and stir well, cooking for 3-4 minutes more.
Add the scallions and coconut milk, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the coconut milk is boiling and begins to thicken.
Add the marinated chicken and stir well. Cook the chicken for 5 minutes, or until starting to brown. Season with pepper.
Add the chicken broth to the pot and stir.
Bring to a rolling boil and cover the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes, until the sauce thickens into a gravy.
Garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
