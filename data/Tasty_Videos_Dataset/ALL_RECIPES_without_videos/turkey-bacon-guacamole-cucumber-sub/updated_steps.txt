Use a vegetable peeler to peel the cucumbers.
On a cutting board, cut off the ends and cut the cucumbers in half.
Scoop out the seeds and discard.
Spread guacamole on both sides of the prepared cucumber.
Layer the turkey on one half of the cucumber and bacon on the other half, and close the sandwich.
Enjoy!
