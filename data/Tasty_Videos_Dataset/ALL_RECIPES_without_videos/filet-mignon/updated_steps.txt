On a cutting board, pat the filet mignon dry with paper towels and let sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Generously season all sides of the filet mignon with salt and pepper.
Heat a medium, oven-safe stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat for 5 minutes.
Add the grapeseed oil.
Once the oil beings to smoke, add the filet mignon to the pan.
Cook without moving for 2-3 minutes, until a crust has formed.
Use tongs to flip the steak over, then add the butter, rosemary, and garlic to the pan.
Tilt the pan and spoon the butter continuously over the steak for 2-3 minutes.
Transfer the pan to the oven for 7 minutes for a medium rare steak.
Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
Enjoy!
