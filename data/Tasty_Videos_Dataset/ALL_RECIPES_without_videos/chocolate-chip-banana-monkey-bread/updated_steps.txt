Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Cut two bananas into half coins.
Cut one banana into coins and line the bottom of a greased bundt pan.
In a bowl mix sugar and cinnamon, set aside.
Cut each biscuit round in half and flatten into rounds.
Stuff each round with one piece of the halved banana coins and chocolate chips.
Close the round together by pinching at the seam and roll into a ball in your hands.
Place the balls in the cinnamon sugar mix and gently toss to coat.
Place half the balls in the pan.
In a saucepan over medium heat melt the butter and brown sugar until one, stirring occasionally.
Set aside to cool.
Pour half of the glaze on top.
Sprinkle a handful of chocolate chips over top.
Then place rest of the balls on top followed by the rest of the glaze.
Bake for 40-50 minutes until the crust is a deep dark brown on top.
(If the top is browning too much you can cover it with aluminum foil.)
Remove from oven and allow it to cool or about 15-30 minutes before turning it over onto a plate.
Enjoy!
