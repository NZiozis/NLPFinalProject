With a jar or cookie cutter, cut 2 circles into each piece of bread. Place in muffin tin cups.
Wrap a piece of cooked bacon along the edge of each muffin cup—make sure the bacon is JUST cooked and still warm, so it doesn’t break or crumble.
Sprinkle ½ Tbsp. of shredded cheese into each cup.
Top with an egg. Season with salt & pepper, and bake at 400°F (205°C) for 15 min (longer for firmer yolk).
Top with green onion.
Enjoy!
