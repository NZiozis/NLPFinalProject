Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a large bowl, mix the flour and yogurt together until the dough comes together in a ball.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into 8 equal portions.
Working 1 at a time, roll each portion of dough into a log about 4 inches (10 cm) long. Shape the log into a ring and transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Brush the tops of the bagels with egg wash and generously season with salt.
Bake for 17 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the bagels are cooked through.
