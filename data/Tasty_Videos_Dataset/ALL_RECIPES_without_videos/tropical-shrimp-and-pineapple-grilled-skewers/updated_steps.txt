Place wooden skewers in a bowl of water to soak for at least 10 minutes.
Puree the pineapple, garlic, chili sauce, and water in a food processor.
Heat a pan over medium heat, and add the pureed sauce mixture.
Add vinegar, salt, coconut cream, lime juice, and zest of one lime.
Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Reduce heat to a simmer.
Mix the cornstarch and water in a small bowl to create the slurry, then add the mixture into the sauce and simmer until the sauce thickens, about a minute.
Skewer the pineapple and shrimp, then brush sauce on both sides.
Grill skewers over medium-high heat until cooked, about 2-3 minutes per side.
Sprinkle finished skewers with lime zest and serve with remaining sauce.
Enjoy!
