Start by activating the yeast. Add yeast and malt syrup to warm water, stir until dissolved. Once the yeast mix starts bubbling, you'll know the yeast is active.
Combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add the activated yeast mix and form a loose dough in the bowl.
Turn dough out onto your surface and knead until everything comes together nicely. (If it’s too dry, add more water a little bit at a time.) Transfer dough to an oiled bowl, cover and let the dough rest for 45 minutes.
While the dough is resting, prep your cream cheese. Freeze cream cheese into 1 tbsp. balls.
Punch down dough after 45 minutes, knead the dough a few times. Pull a handful of dough, form into a ball then flatten and wrap around a frozen cream cheese ball. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Place bagel balls on a parchment paper, cover and let it rest for 20 minutes.
While the bagel balls are resting, bring your poaching liquid ingredients to a boil over medium heat.
Take the rested bagel balls and boil in the poaching liquid for 15-20 seconds. Remove and place on parchment paper.
Brush with egg wash and sprinkle desired bagel toppings.
Bake in 325°F (160°C) preheated oven for 20 - 30 minutes until top is golden brown.
Enjoy!
