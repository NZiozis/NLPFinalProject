In a blender, combine the strawberries, 1 cup (180 g) kiwi, wine, lemonade, and vodka and blend until smooth.
Place 1 slice of kiwi in each ice pop mold.
Pour the mixture into the ice pop molds, seal with the lids, and add the ice pop sticks.
Freeze until solid, at least 4 hours, or overnight.
Carefully remove the ice pops from the molds.
Enjoy!
