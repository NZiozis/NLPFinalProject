Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Cut the puff pastry into six rectangles and place on a nonstick baking tray.
On one rectangle, place a slice of cheddar, 1 scrambled egg, and 2 pieces of ham.
Place a rectangle of pastry on top and seal the edges with a fork.
Repeat with remaining pastry rectangles.
Brush with egg wash.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is flaky and golden.
Enjoy!
