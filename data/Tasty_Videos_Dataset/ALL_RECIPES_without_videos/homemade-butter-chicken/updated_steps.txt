Preheat the oven 220˚C (430˚F).
On a cutting board, slice the chicken into bite size pieces.
Combine the chicken with the rest of the marinade ingredients in a bowl.
Mix until evenly coated.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Skewer the marinated chicken pieces on bamboo skewers, then place them over a baking tray lined with parchment paper, making sure there is space underneath the chicken to help distribute the heat more evenly.
Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly dark brown on the edges.
Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat, then sauté the onions and tomato purée, until tender but not browned.
Add the spices and fry for about 30 seconds to release their aromatics and flavor, stirring constantly.
Pour in the cream and mix it well with the onion and spices.
When the cream mixture is bubbling, add in the chicken and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
Serve with rice and naan bread.
Enjoy!
