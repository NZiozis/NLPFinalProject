In a large pot, cook the pasta according to the package instructions.
Drain and set aside.
Heat the olive oil in the same pot over medium heat.
Add the onion and sauté until translucent, about 2 minutes.
Stir in the carrots, celery, mushrooms, salt, and pepper.
Sauté until mushrooms have cooked down and are turning golden, about 5 minutes.
Add the wine and simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 4 minutes.
Add the garlic and stir to combine, then add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, broth, lentils, basil, oregano, rosemary, and baking soda.
Stir to combine.
Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 40 minutes, until the bolognese is thickened.
Serve the bolognese over the pasta, or, for a lighter option, use zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash.
Garnish with parsley.
Enjoy!
