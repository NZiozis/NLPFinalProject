Preheat oven to 375°F / 190°C
Cut biscuits into fourths, and place in a large mixing bowl.
Add the butter, garlic powder, parsley, and mozzarella, and mix with your hands, coating all of the biscuit pieces.
Place the pieces in a muffin tin, 3 pieces per tin (you’ll have 2 extra—just use them in whichever tin you want).
Bake for 15 minutes.
Best served fresh out of the oven!
Enjoy!
