Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Roll the cookie dough into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) balls and place them in a greased muffin tin.
Using your hands or a shaped tool, press the dough balls down so they form a cup shape.
Bake for 10-15 minutes.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the softened cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until smooth and no lumps remain.
Fold in the whipped topping.
Scoop the cheesecake filling into a piping bag or a plastic sandwich bag.
Once the cookie cups have baked and cooled, remove them from the muffin tin.
Pipe the cheesecake filling into each cup.
Serve with chocolate syrup or fresh fruit.
Enjoy!
