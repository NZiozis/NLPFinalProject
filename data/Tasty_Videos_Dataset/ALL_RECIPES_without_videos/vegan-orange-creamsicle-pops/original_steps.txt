Add the orange juice, yogurt, and agave to a blender and blend until well-combined.
Pour the blended mixture into the ice pop mold.
Freeze until solid, 2-3 hours.
If desired, dip the frozen pops in yogurt and sprinkle with orange zest. Place the pops on a parchment paper-lined plate and freeze again for 30 minutes.
The pops will keep in the freezer for up to 6 months in an airtight container.
Enjoy!
