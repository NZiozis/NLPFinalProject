In a mixing bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, chili, honey, and soy sauce.
Mix in the chicken drumsticks.
Cover with cling film and leave to marinate in the fridge for 4-6 hours, or overnight.
Fry the chicken in a large pan, on all sides for about 10-15 minutes, stirring often to prevent the marinade from burning, until golden brown.
Remove from the pan and pour in the marinade.
Bring to a boil and stir, until the marinade is thick and resembles a sauce.
Throw the chicken back in the pan and fry for a further 5-10 minutes in the sauce, making sure each drumstick is evenly coated and cooked through.
Garnish with sesame seeds and spring onions.
Enjoy!
