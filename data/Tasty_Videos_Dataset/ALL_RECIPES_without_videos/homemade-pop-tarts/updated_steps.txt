Cut puff pastry along fold lines and then in half, making 6 rectangular pieces.
Coat edges of one section of pastry with egg wash (egg and milk whisked).
Place desired amount of filling (we used equal parts of each jam) in the center and spread, leaving room on the edges.
Then place a second piece of puff pastry on top, Push the edges of the two pastry pieces together with your fingers and then press with a fork to seal.
Bake on wax paper at 190°C (375°F) for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown and puffy.
For icing, mix all ingredients together.
Add additional milk or sugar to achieve desired consistency.
Apply to slightly cooked pastries.
Enjoy!
