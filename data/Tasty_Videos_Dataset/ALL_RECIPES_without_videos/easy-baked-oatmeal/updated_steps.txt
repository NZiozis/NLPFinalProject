Preheat the oven to 350°F (180˚C).
Oil a 9x9-inch (22x22-cm) baking dish with ½ tablespoon of the coconut oil and add 1½ cups (190 g) of the cranberries in a single layer.
In a large bowl, mix together the rolled oats, walnuts, ¼ cup (20 g) coconut flakes, cinnamon, ginger, and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons coconut oil, milk, maple syrup, egg, and vanilla.
Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and stir just to combine.
Pour the oat mixture over the cranberry layer in the baking dish and sprinkle with the remaining cranberries and coconut flakes.
Bake until the top of the oatmeal is set, 30-40 minutes.
Serve warm with milk or yogurt, flaky salt, and maple syrup, if desired.
Enjoy!
