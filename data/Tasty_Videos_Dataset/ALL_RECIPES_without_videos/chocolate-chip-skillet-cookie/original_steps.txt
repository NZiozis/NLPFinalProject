Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C).
Press ⅔ of the cookie dough into the bottom and up the sides of a small skillet or a small cake pan.
Place the chocolate chunks in the middle of the cookie dough, then place the other flattened ⅓ of the cookie dough on top.
Crimp the edges of the dough together to seal in the chocolate.
Bake for 35-40 minutes.
Serve warm with ice cream and caramel sauce.
Enjoy!
