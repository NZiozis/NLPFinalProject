In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the milk and yeast and let sit for 5 minutes, or until it starts to bubble.
Add the flour, sugar, and salt to the bowl with the yeast.
Add the dough hook attachment, and mix for 30 seconds, or until the dough is shaggy.
Add the eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated, about 2 minutes.
Add the butter 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until fully incorporated.
If the dough is too sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time.
Once the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 4 minutes.
Place the dough in a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C)
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 12x6-inch (30x15 cm) rectangle.
In a small bowl, whisk the egg and heavy cream until well combined.
Brush the mixture over the rolled out dough.
Spread the blueberries in an even layer over the bread.
Starting at the bottom, carefully roll the dough up into a log.
Place the dough in a parchment paper-lined loaf pan.
Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.
Brush the dough with the remaining egg wash, and sprinkle with turbinado sugar.
Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.
Rest for 15 to 20 minutes, then remove from pan.
Enjoy!
