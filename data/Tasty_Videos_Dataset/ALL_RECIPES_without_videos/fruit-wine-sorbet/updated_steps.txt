Make the simple syrup by dissolving one cup of sugar into one cup (240 ml) of water.
Blend strawberries, pineapple, blackberries, raspberries, mango, wine, and simple syrup until well combined (you may have to do this in two batches).
Pour mixture into a 9Ã—9 inch (23x23 cm) glass pan, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze overnight.
Scoop and serve with fresh strawberry (optional).
Enjoy!
