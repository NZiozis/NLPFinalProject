Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the habanero peppers and garlic on the baking sheet.
Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and toss with tongs to coat.
NOTE: Do not touch the peppers with your bare hands.
Roast for 10 minutes, until the edges of the peppers are brown.
Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to a large pot over high heat.
Add the carrot, onion, and salt.
Cook for 4 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and glossy.
Add the water, lime juice, white vinegar, and the roasted peppers and stir.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove the pot from the heat and let cool.
Pour the vegetable mixture into a blender and puree until smooth.
Using a funnel, pour the sauce into a bottle or jar and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Enjoy!
