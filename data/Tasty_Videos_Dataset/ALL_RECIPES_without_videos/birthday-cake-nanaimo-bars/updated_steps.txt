In a bain-marie, melt the butter, sugar, and cocoa powder.
Stir in the egg and keep stirring for a minute until the mix thickens.
Remove the bowl from heat.
Add the graham cracker crumbs, the almonds (chopped finely), and the coconut flakes.
When well mixed, pour into an 8 x 8 inch (20x20 cm) pan and flatten until you get an even layer.
Cream the custard powder, softened butter, and heavy cream until smooth.
Add the powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
Add the sprinkles and mix.
Pour the mixture on top of the crust and spread it until you get an even layer.
In a bain marie, slowly melt the white chocolate and the butter.
Cool it down a little bit then pour it over middle layer.
Chill the bars for at least 3 hours.
Cut them into 9 even squares and sprinkle each one with rainbow sprinkles.
Enjoy!
