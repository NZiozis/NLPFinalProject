NOTE: If you have unroasted nuts, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Spread almonds onto a baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes or until you can smell them.
In a food processor, blend roasted almonds.
Scrape down the sides when necessary.
Once the almonds look creamy, add the espresso powder and vanilla extract.
Continue blending until the mixture turns into a ball and evens out again.
Slowly add canola oil while still blending.
Pour into a jar, store in a refrigerator and use within one month.
Enjoy!
