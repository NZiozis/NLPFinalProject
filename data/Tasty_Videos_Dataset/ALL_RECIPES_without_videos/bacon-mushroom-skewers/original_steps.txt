Thread one end of the bacon onto the end of a skewer. Add a mushroom half, and weave the bacon around the mushroom and back through the skewer, creating a wave pattern between the mushrooms.
Move the bacon and the mushrooms down the skewer, repeating until the other edge of the bacon is threaded through.
Repeat with remaining bacon and mushrooms.
Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
Sear 3-4 skewers at a time, seasoning with salt and pepper, and flip when the undersides are golden brown.
Season the other side with salt and pepper and cook until bacon is as crispy as youâ€™d like.
Cool and serve!
Enjoy!
