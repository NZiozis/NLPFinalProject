Fill each plastic glove with water until about 2 inches (5 cm) from the opening of the glove. Twist the opening and tie into a knot.
Place in a tray, draping some gloves over others if you want some of the fingers to appear bent. Freeze for at least 4 hours, or overnight, until solid.
Make the lychee eyeballs: Place a blueberry inside each lychee.
Use a toothpick to paint a bit of red food coloring on the outside of the lychees to mimic veins on an eyeball. Add the lychees to a large punch bowl.
Pour in the cranberry juice, ginger ale, reserved lychee juice, and vodka, if using.
Remove the gloves from the freezer and run under warm water for 15 seconds. Use scissors to cut off the knot and then slide the ice out of each glove and into the punch.
To serve, ladle punch and a couple eyeballs into glasses.
Enjoy!
