NOTE: If you have unroasted nuts, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread peanuts onto a baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes or until you can smell them.
In a food processor, blend peanuts. Scrape down the sides when necessary.
When the peanuts have broken down and become crumbly, add in honey and salt while still blending.
The mixture will turn into a ball and eventually even out.
Slowly add canola oil while still blending. Add more canola oil if you want a creamier texture.
Pour into a jar, store in a refrigerator and use within one month.
Enjoy!
