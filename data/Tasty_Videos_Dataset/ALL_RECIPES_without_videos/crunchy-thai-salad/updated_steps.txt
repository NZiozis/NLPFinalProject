In a large mason jar, add the peanut butter, soy sauce and sriracha and stir to combine.
Add the cabbage, broccoli florets, bell pepper, chives, carrots, peanuts, and lettuce and screw on the lid.
Store in the refrigerator until ready to eat, up to 5 days.
Give the mason jar a good shake to mix and use a fork or spoon to stir as needed.
Enjoy!
