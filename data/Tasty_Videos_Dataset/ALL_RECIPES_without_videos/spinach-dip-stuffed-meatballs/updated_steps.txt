Mix cream cheese, spinach, garlic powder, and mozzarella until smooth.
Mix ground beef, pork, egg, parsley, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper until evenly combined.
Take a golf ball-sized handful of the meatball mixture and press it flat in the palm of your hand.
Place a spoonful of the spinach dip in the center of the meat and fold the edges over the dip, sealing it and rolling into a ball.
Repeat with the remaining meat and dip.
In a pan over medium-high heat, sear meatballs for about a minute, then flip.
Add the marinara sauce and mix.
Cook for about 15 minutes, until meatballs are cooked through and sauce is thick.
Serve with fettuccine.
Enjoy!
