Crush all graham crackers into large chunks. Around the size of a quarter works best.
Microwave marshmallows and butter together in a large bowl for about two minutes, stopping to stir after one and a half minutes. Marshmallows should still be a little fluffy, but fully combined with the butter.
Add graham crackers to marshmallows and mix until crackers are well coated.
Place mixture in a large dish and spread evenly.
Microwave chocolate chips for 60 seconds, stopping after 30 seconds to check and stir. If still not melted, microwave in 15 second increments until melted.
Cover with melted chocolate.
Cut into equal pieces.
Enjoy!
