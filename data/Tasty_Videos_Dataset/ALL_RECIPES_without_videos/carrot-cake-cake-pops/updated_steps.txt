Break the cake into a large bowl, crumble it until it is in fine crumbs.
Add sweet condensed milk and mix until you form a dough.
Open a small amount of dough and cover one brigadeiro in it, rolling until you form a ball.
Add one stick into each ball and freeze for 15 minutes.
Dip your cake pops into melted chocolate, covering them.
Let it rest and add some sprinkles on them.
Enjoy!
