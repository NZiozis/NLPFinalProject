Place cookies into plastic bag and smash until fine crumbles form, or use a food processor and make it as fine as possible.
In a large bowl, combine cookie crumbs and melted butter and mix until it clusters.
In a cupcake tin, put a spoonful of the crumb mixture and form into crusts.
Freeze for 2 hours.
In a medium saucepan, heat sugar and water until amber brown. Do not stir!
Take off the heat and pour in the heavy cream and vanilla, stirring until caramel forms. Caution: adding the cream will cause sugar to boil, so carefully mix.
Quickly pour caramel into the cookie crust and let it sit until caramel is firm. Approximately 5 minutes.
Heat up the heavy cream and add the dark chocolate. Let the chocolate sit for a minute and stir until smooth.
Pour a spoonful of chocolate over the caramel and then refrigerate for an hour or until the chocolate is firm.
Sprinkle the tarts with some sea salt to balance sweetness if desired.
Enjoy!
