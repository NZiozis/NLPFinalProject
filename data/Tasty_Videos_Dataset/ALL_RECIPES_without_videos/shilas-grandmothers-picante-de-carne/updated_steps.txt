Season the steak with salt, pepper, and cumin.
Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat.
Add the steak and cook until browned, about 5-6 minutes.
Remove the steak from the pot and set aside.
Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pot, then add the onion and sauté until translucent, about 5-6 minutes.
Add the garlic and ají amarillo, and sauté for 3 minutes, until fragrant.
Return the steak to the pot, then add the water and bouillon.
Mix to dissolve the bouillon powder.
Add the potatoes and carrots.
Bring the stew to a simmer, cover, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the potato and carrot are cooked through.
Add the peas and Peruvian corn.
Cook for another 5 minutes, or until the peas and corn are cooked through.
Serve the picante de carne with rice and sunny-side up eggs.
Sprinkle chopped parsley on top.
Enjoy!
