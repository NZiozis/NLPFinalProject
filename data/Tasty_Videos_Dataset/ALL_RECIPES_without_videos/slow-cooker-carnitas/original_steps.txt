Cut pork into 6 equal pieces. Add it to the slow cooker.
Add salt, pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic, onion, bay leaves, lime juice and juice the orange. Add orange to the cooker as well. Mix together until the meat is well-coated.
Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours, or until the meat pulls apart easily.
Remove the pork and transfer to a foil-lined baking sheet. Shred the pork and spread across the baking sheet in a single layer.
Pour about 1 cup (235 ml) of the liquid remaining in the slow cooker over the shredded pork. Broil for 5-10 minutes until the meat browns and crisps along the edges.
Serve immediately. Great as a filling in tacos, burritos, salads, or nachos!
Enjoy!
