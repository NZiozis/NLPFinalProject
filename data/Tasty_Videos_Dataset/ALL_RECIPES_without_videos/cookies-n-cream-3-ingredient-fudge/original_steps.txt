In a mixing bowl, combine chocolate with sweetened condensed milk and melt in the microwave in 15-second increments.
Once chocolate is fully melted, add in chopped cookies and stir until combined.
Pour chocolate mixture into a parchment paper-lined 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) baking tin.
Chill for 2 hours or until the fudge is firm.
Cut into bite-sized pieces.
Enjoy!
