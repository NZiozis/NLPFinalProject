Preheat oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Cut eggplant and bell pepper into medium-sized pieces, being sure to remove the seeds, and spread them out on a baking sheet that has been lined with parchment paper.
Lightly coat the vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Roast the vegetables for 20-25 minutes, until the edges begin to char and the skin blisters.
Add roasted vegetables to a food processor along with the beans, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, and seasonings.
Pulse until the ingredients are roughly chopped.
Then, with the machine running, slowly pour in the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil into the food processor and blend until the mixture is smooth.
Transfer mixture to a bowl and serve with freshly cut vegetables, crackers, or pita bread.
Alternatively, the mixture can be placed into individual serving-sized containers and stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
Enjoy!
