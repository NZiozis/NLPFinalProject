Make the sponge: Stir together the yeast, honey or maple syrup, water, and flour together in a medium bowl. Some lumps are okay. Cover with a kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place for 20-30 minutes, until foamy and expanded in volume.
To finish the dough, add the salt, olive oil, and warm water to the bowl with the sponge. Add the flour in ½-cup (60 g) increments, stirring to incorporate each addition before adding the next, until the dough comes together enough to knead with your hands. Knead in the bowl briefly, until most of the flour in the bowl is incorporated.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and continue kneading, adding more flour as needed, until it is soft, pliable, and does not stick to your hands, 8-10 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a clean bowl lightly greased with olive oil. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 40 minutes, or until doubled in volume.
Preheat the oven to 475˚F (240˚C).
Remove the dough from the bowl and punch down. Cut in half. Dust a piece of dough with flour and roll out to about a 13x18-inch (33x46-cm) rectangle or oval.  Repeat with the remaining dough portion if making 2 pizzas, or wrap the leftover dough tightly in plastic wrap and keep in the fridge for up to 3 days.
Drizzle a baking sheet with olive oil and sprinkle with semolina flour. Transfer the rolled out dough to the baking sheet.
Add your toppings of choice. For a gravy, turkey, and stuffing pizza, spread the gravy over the pizza dough. Top with the stuffing, turkey, cheese, and rosemary, if using.
For a cranberry sauce, Brussels sprout, and sweet potato pizza, add the cranberry sauce to a blender with a bit of water and puree until smooth.
Spread over the pizza dough and top with dollops of mashed sweet potato, the Brussels sprouts, and spoonfuls of the goat cheese.
Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, until the dough is crispy and golden brown and the toppings are warmed through.
Slice and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
