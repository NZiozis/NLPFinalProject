Microwave the corn on a microwave-safe plate on high for 7 minutes.
Remove from the microwave, and grip the corn with a dish towel.
Then cut off the bottom end with a serrated knife.
Slide the corn out of the husk.
It should come out fairly easily with none of the silky string mess.
Brush the corn with olive oil, then place on a cast iron grill pan or outdoor grill over medium-high heat.
Grill for 5-6 minutes on each side, until the kernels are slightly charred.
Insert the narrow end of an ear of corn into the center hole of a bundt pan.
Holding the corn steady with one hand, saw off the kernels with a serrated knife.
The kernels will fall into the pan for easy collection.
Make the cilantro-lime vinaigrette: Combine the cilantro, olive oil, lime juice, garlic, chili powder, honey, salt, and pepper in a food processor and blend until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the pasta, corn, tomatoes, red onion, avocado, and vinaigrette, and mix until well-combined.
Enjoy!
