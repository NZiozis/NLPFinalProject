Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Place 5-inch (10 cm) greased cookie cutters on a greased baking pan.
Fill the bottom of each cookie cutter with ½-inch (1 cm) of brownie batter.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until cooked through.
Remove from the oven and let the brownies cool
In a medium bowl combine chocolate chips and hot heavy cream.
Let stand for 1 minute, then stir until the ganache is a smooth, silky consistency.
Fill each cookie cutter with a layer of raspberries, then pour the chocolate ganache over the top of the raspberries until it fills in the cookie cutters.
Refrigerate for 2 hours, or until the ganache is set.
Remove from the fridge and gently push the bottom of the brownies until they pop out of the cookie cutters.
Sift powdered sugar over the top and serve.
Pairs well with Merlot.
Enjoy!
