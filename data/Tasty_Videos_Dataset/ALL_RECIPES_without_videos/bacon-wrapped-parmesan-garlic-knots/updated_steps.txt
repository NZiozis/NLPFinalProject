Add the warm water to a medium bowl.
Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let sit for 5 minutes, or until mixture is frothy.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, Parmesan cheese, sugar, baking powder, salt, basil, and oregano.
Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the yeast-water mixture.
Mix with a rubber spatula until a ball of dough forms.
Dump the dough out onto a clean surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until the dough is springy.
Grease the large bowl with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.
Place the dough in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough then dump onto a clean surface.
Tear the dough into 30 separate pieces, then roll into 6-inch (15-cm) long strips.
Place a strip of bacon over each dough strip.
Tie both together to form a knot.
Place the knots on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until bread is golden brown and the bacon is crispy.
In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic, and remaining 2 teaspoons of Parmesan cheese.
Brush the knots with the butter mixture and bake for another 5 minutes.
Transfer to a serving plate.
Garnish with chopped parsley.
Serve with marinara sauce alongside.
Enjoy!
