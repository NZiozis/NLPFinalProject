Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with a reusable baking mat or parchment paper.
Arrange poblanos on the prepared baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skins begin to turn brown and pull away from the flesh.
Meanwhile, make the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the red onion, season with salt, and sauté for 3 minutes, until beginning to soften. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the cumin, coriander, and cayenne and stir to coat the vegetables with the spices.
Add the quinoa, beans, corn, tomato sauce, and lime juice and season with salt. Stir to combine, then cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chopped cilantro.
Transfer the roasted poblanos to a bowl and cover with a plate or plastic wrap. Steam for 15 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C).
Peel the skins off the poblanos. Leaving the stem intact, cut a slit lengthwise down each pepper to form a pouch. With a small spoon, carefully remove the seeds. The poblano flesh will be delicate—it’s fine if it tears a bit.
Lay the peeled poblanos side by side in a greased 9-x13-inch (22 cm x 33 cm) baking dish. Stuff each pepper with about ½ cup of the filling. Top each pepper with 2 tablespoons of Monterey Jack cheese.
Bake the stuffed peppers for 15-20 minutes, until the filling is completely warmed through and the cheese is melted and beginning to brown.
Serve the peppers garnished with cilantro leaves and serve with avocado slices and lime wedges.
Enjoy!
