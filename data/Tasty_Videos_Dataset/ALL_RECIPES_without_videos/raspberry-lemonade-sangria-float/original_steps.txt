In a large pitcher, combine the raspberries, lemon slices, white wine, white rum, and lemonade. Stir and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.
Place 1-2 small scoops of raspberry sorbet in a glass. Remove the sangria from the refrigerator and pour it over the sorbet. Stir with a spoon to combine.
Garnish with fresh raspberries and a lemon slice.
Enjoy!
