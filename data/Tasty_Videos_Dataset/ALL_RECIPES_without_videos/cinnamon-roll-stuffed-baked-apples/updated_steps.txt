Slice off the top of each apple and hollow out using a melon baller - being careful not to cut through the sides and to leave a thicker base.
Brush the inside of each apple with melted butter and a sprinkling of brown sugar and cinnamon.
Place a cinnamon roll in each apple.
Bake in a preheated oven at 350˚F (180˚C) for 15 minutes uncovered and then an additional 25-30 minutes covered loosely with foil.
Remove from over and drizzle with icing.
Serve warm.
Enjoy!
