Cut the bananas in half horizontally.
Insert popsicle sticks in the middle of the banana halves.
Transfer bananas to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and freeze until solid.
In a tall glass or mixing cup, add chocolate and coconut oil.
Microwave in 30-second intervals for 1 minute and a half, and mix until smooth.
In a bowl, mix the peanut butter and almond milk until smooth.
Dip the bananas into the chocolate coating, then drizzle the peanut butter sauce on the banana.
Place bananas in freezer until the coating has hardened.
Enjoy!
