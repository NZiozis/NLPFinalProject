In a small bowl, combine all the Cajun spice rub ingredients and stir.
Place the salmon fillets on a cutting board and rub the olive oil over all sides of the salmon fillets.
Sprinkle the spice rub over the salmon, using your hands to ensure all sides are covered.
Cook on a BBQ over a medium to high heat for 2 minutes per side. The outside should start to blacken and crisp, leaving the salmon juicy inside.
Once the salmon is cooked set aside.
In a large bowl, add all of the salsa ingredients and stir well.
Serve the salmon with an extra sprinkling of parsley alongside the salsa.
Enjoy!
