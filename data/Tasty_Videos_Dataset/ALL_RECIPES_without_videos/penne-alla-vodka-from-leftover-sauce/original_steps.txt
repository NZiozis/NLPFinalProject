In a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil and onion, and cook until the onion is slightly translucent.
Add the garlic, salt, and vodka, and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add the tomato sauce and heavy cream, and bring to a boil.
Add the cooked penne and stir until the sauce evenly coats the pasta.
Serve warm with Parmesan and parsley.
Enjoy!
