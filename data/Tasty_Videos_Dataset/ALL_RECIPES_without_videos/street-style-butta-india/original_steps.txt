Blanch the corn in a large pot of boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove the corn from the pot.
Heat the ghee in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add the corn and cook, turning occasionally, until nicely browned on all sides. Transfer to a serving plate.
Squeeze the lime juice all over the corn.
In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, cumin, cayenne, garam masala, and salt. Sprinkle all over the corn.
Enjoy!
