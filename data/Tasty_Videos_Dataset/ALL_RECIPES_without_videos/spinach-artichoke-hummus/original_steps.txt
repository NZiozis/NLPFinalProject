Add chickpeas, spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, and seasonings to the bowl of a 2-quart food processor. Blend until smooth.
While blending, slowly add in the olive oil until hummus is creamy and smooth.
Garnish with a few leaves of spinach, additional chopped artichoke hearts, and a drizzle of olive oil.
Enjoy!
