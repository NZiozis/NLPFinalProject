Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C).
Take a golf ball-size handful of cookie dough and press it flat.
Place a sandwich cookie in the center, then fold the cookie dough around the edges, making sure there are no gaps. Press and shape the dough around the cookie, then repeat with remaining dough and cookies.
Place them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and bake for 14 minutes.
Enjoy!
