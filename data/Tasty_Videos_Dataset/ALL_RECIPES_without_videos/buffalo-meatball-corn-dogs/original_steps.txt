Meatballs: In a medium bowl, mix together ground chicken, bread crumbs, egg, blue cheese, salt, pepper, and Frank’s Red Hot until evenly combined. Be careful not to overmix. Roll into golf-size balls.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs and cook until brown on all sides, about 3–4 minutes per side. Remove meatballs from the pan (they will not be fully cooked at this time).
Batter: Whisk together cornmeal, flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder. Add in egg and milk, then whisk until a smooth batter forms.
Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil in a pot until temperature is 350ºF (175ºC).
Place the meatballs on skewers, lollipop-style. Holding onto the skewer, dip the meatball into the batter. Use a spoon to help fully coat each meatball in batter.
Lower the meatballs into the oil and cook for 3–4 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through and the outsides are a deep golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve with more Frank’s and ranch dressing for dipping.
Enjoy!
