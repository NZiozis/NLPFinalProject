Cut each egg in half and remove the yolk.
Place the yolks in a medium bowl, and refrigerate the whites while you prepare the filling.
In a large bowl bowl, mix together the avocado, Greek yogurt, mustard, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
Add the egg yolks and mash with a fork to incorporate.
For a smoother filling, add the ingredients to a food processor and pulse to combine.
Transfer the filing to a piping bag fitted with a round tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off.
Pipe the filling into the egg whites.
Sprinkle with paprika.
Enjoy!
