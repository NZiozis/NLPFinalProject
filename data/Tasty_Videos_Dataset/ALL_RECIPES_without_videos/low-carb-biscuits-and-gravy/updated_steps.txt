Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Make the biscuits: In a medium bowl, add the almond flour, baking powder, and salt.
Whisk to combine.
In a separate large bowl, add the Greek yogurt, eggs, and honey.
Whisk to combine.
Sift the dry ingredients through a fine-mesh sieve into the wet ingredients.
Mix to combine until fluffy.
Do not overmix.
Using a large ice cream scoop or a large spoon, scoop dough onto the lined baking sheet, spacing evenly.
You should have about 6 biscuits.
(If the oven is not ready, keep biscuits in the refrigerator so that they do not spread out and flatten.)
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Make the gravy: Drizzle a bit of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the sausage and cook 7-10 minutes, or until browned.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and add ¼ cup (25 g) of almond flour, the cayenne, paprika, rosemary, sage, salt, and pepper.
Stir to combine, then add the milk.
Simmer the gravy until it reaches your desired consistency, stirring occasionally.
You can add up to ¼ cup (25 g) more almond flour for a thicker, heartier gravy.
Serve the gravy hot, poured over a warm biscuit.
Enjoy!
