Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.
Heat a cast-iron skillet or pan over medium-high heat, and add the chicken skin side down.
Cook the chicken until it has a dark brown and crispy skin.
Flip the chicken and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 more minutes.
Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
Add the garlic and onion to the remaining chicken fat and cook, stirring frequently until the onions are softened and caramelized.
Add the brown sugar, chicken broth, thyme, and parsley and stir to combine.
Bring the sauce to a boil and and cook for 1-2 minutes, until slightly reduced.
Add the chicken back to the pan and coat it in the garlic brown sugar sauce.
Enjoy!
