Whisk the egg in a small bowl.
Add ½ cup (60 g) of flour and the cold water and whisk to combine.
Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator.
Add the remaining flour to a shallow dish.
Dredge each shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess.
Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180˚C).
Dip the floured shrimp into the chilled batter.
Fry the shrimp until they float to the top and are golden brown in color.
Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
In a medium pan, combine the dashi, soy sauce, and mirin, and bring to a boil over high heat.
Transfer to a small bowl.
To make the onigiri rice balls, first wet your palms with water and coat with a little bit of salt.
Take a handful of rice and make an indent in the middle.
Dip a shrimp into the soy sauce mixture, then place in the center of the rice.
Wrap the rice around the shrimp, creating a triangle shape.
Wrap a strip of seaweed around the rice ball.
Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Enjoy!
