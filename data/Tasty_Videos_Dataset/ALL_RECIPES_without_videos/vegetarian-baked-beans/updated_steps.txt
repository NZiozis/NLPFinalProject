Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 4-5 minutes, until semi-translucent.
Add the garlic and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.
Add the paprika, chili powder, mustard powder, salt, and pepper and cook for 2 more minutes, until the spices are fragrant.
Add the tomato paste, maple syrup, molasses, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and liquid smoke and stir for 1-2 minutes, until well-combined.
Then, add the vegetable broth and stir until smooth, about 1 minute.
Add the beans and stir for 1-2 minutes, until evenly coated.
Cover and bake for 40 minutes, until the beans are bubbling.
Uncover and bake for another 10 minutes, or until desired consistency is reached.
Stir well and serve.
Enjoy!
