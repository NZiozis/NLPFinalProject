Slice the pizza dough into 8 equal pieces, then press each piece flat.
Place 4 pieces of dough into a preheated, greased waffle iron.
Spread one tablespoon of marinara, Â¼ cup (25 grams) of mozzarella, and 3 slices of pepperoni on each piece of dough.
Top with the 4 remaining pieces of dough and seal.
Cook for 3-5 minutes, until golden brown, then serve.
Enjoy!
