Preheat Oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Wrap pasta in a clean dish towel and fold twice, breaking pasta into smaller 1-3 inch (2½ - 7½ cm) pieces.
Cook until al dente (about 3 minutes) and drain well.
In medium-sized bowl, mix warm cooked pasta with garlic, butter, grated parmesan, egg, and bread crumbs. Still until well incorporated and the butter and cheese have completely melted.
Press pasta mixture into a deep 10-inch (25-cm) pie plate or casserole dish. Top with bread crumbs.
Bake 15-20 minutes, until crust is set and edges have started to brown
Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add onions and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add in ground beef and cook until lightly browned. Using a spoon, drain off any excess fat that accumulates in the pan.
Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, and sugar. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in basil. Season with salt and pepper.
In a small bowl, mix together ricotta, egg, and oregano.
Spread ricotta mixture over the cooked pasta crust. Spread the meat sauce over the top of the ricotta mixture then cover with mozzarella. Bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for 25 minutes or until golden brown on top.
Let cool for 15-20 minutes before serving.
Fancy-Pants Parmesan Crisps (optional for garnish): Pour a tablespoon of parmesan cheese onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 400˚F (200˚C) until cheese has melted and become golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Let cool before removing from parchment paper.
Enjoy!
