Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C)
Remove tofu from packaging and drain.
Place tofu on a couple of paper towels and find a heavy object to place on top of tofu, leave it there for 20 minutes.
Slice the tofu into bite-sized pieces.
Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl then add the tofu.
Mix until evenly coated.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Place the marinated tofu pieces on bamboo skewers, then place them over a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
Make sure there is space underneath the tofu to help distribute the heat more evenly.
Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly dark brown on the edges.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, and sauté the onions, ginger, and garlic until tender but not browned.
Add the spices for about 30 seconds to release their aromatics and flavor, stirring constantly.
Add the tomato sauce and water, then bring to a boil and cook for about 5 minutes.
Pour in the cream and mix in the tofu, cooking for another 1-2 minutes.
Serve with rice and naan bread.
Enjoy!
