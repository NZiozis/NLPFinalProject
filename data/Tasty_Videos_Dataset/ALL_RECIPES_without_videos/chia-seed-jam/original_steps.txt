Combine the berries and water in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently, until the fruit is broken down and the mixture is saucy.
Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the chia seeds, lemon juice, honey (start with a small amount and add more as needed, depending on how sweet the fruit is), and salt.
Let sit for 10 minutes to allow the chia seeds to hydrate and thicken the jam.
Then transfer to a resealable jar. The jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
Enjoy!
