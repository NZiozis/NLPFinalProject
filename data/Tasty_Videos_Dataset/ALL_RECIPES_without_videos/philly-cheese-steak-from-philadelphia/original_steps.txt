Slice the Italian roll 3 quarters of the way through so it can fold open.
Cook the chip steak in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir while cooking to make sure the meat cooks on all sides.
Place the open roll face down on top of the meat, then flip the whole thing over so the meat is inside.
Add cheese whiz and grilled onions.
Enjoy!
