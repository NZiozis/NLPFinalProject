Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Carefully pierce potatoes with a fork. On a baking sheet, oil the potatoes well and sprinkle with salt.
Bake for about one hour. If making more potatoes, an additional 15 minutes per potato is needed.
In a skillet over high heat, add the ground beef with a bit of oil.
Add the taco seasoning, black beans, and tomatoes. You may want to drain the ground beef mixture once cooked if there’s too much liquid.
Once the potatoes are cooled, cut them vertically, scoop out the inside, and transfer to a bowl.
In the bowl with the scooped out potatoes, add the ground beef mixture and cheddar cheese. Mix well.
Scoop the potato mixture back into the potatoes and top with cheddar cheese.
Bake an additional 15 minutes until the cheese is melted.
Serve warm with guacamole.
Enjoy!
