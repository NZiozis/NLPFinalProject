Place the chicken breasts, salt, peppercorns, onion, whole garlic cloves, bay leaves, and water in a large pot.
Cover the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Once the water is simmering, cook for 10 minutes, until the chicken registers 165°F (74°C) when pierced with an instant-read thermometer.
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and reserve at least ¾ cup (180 ml) of the cooking liquid to use as broth. Using 2 forks, pull the chicken apart until shredded.
In a large nonstick pan, heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering.
Add the minced garlic, cumin, paprika, chili powder, and oregano. Sauté until the oil is bubbling and very fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Add the chicken broth and stir until the liquid has reduced and thickened slightly, about 7 minutes.
Add the shredded chicken and mix until everything is well incorporated.
Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool for 5 minutes before spooning into the lettuce leaves.
Top with shredded cheese and diced tomatoes
Enjoy!
