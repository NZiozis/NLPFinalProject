Use top round or top sirloin cuts of beef. Salt all sides generously.
Sear on all sides in a very hot, heavy skillet. If a pool of fat begins to form in the skillet, remove some so that the meat sears evenly.

Cook 2 hours on high, or until internal temperature reaches 130°F (55°C).

Pull the edges of the dough down underneath itself until a smooth loaf is formed. Sprinkle flour on top of the loaf.
Next, sprinkle cornmeal onto a baking sheet and set the loaf on top. Sprinkle flour on top of the loaf. Cover with a dry towel for 30 minutes.
Scar the top with a knife.
Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 35 minutes. Place a pan of water on the rack below the dough in the oven. Cool to room temperature before cutting.
