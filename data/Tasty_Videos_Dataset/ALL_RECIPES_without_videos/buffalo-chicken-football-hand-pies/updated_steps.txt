Preheat to oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine the chicken, salt, pepper, mozzarella cheese, green onions, buffalo sauce, and ranch dressing.
Roll out the pie crusts on a lightly floured surface to about ¼-inch (6 mm) thick.
Using a paring knife, cut thin strips to resemble football laces.
Then, cut out small football shapes from the remaining dough.
Reroll any excess dough and cut out more shapes.
You should have about 48 footballs total.
Transfer 24 football shapes to the prepared baking sheet.
Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the chicken filling into the center of each football, leaving about a ½-inch (1 cm) border around the edges.
Brush the edges with egg wash and place another football on top, pressing the edges with your finger.
Crimp the edges with a fork to seal.
Arrange the lace cutouts on top of the footballs.
Brush more egg wash over the tops.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
Serve with ranch dressing, if desired.
Enjoy!
