In a bowl, whisk the eggs.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Whisk to combine.
Add the butter to a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Once the butter has melted and begins to bubble, turn the heat to low, and add the eggs.
Using a spatula, gently push the eggs back and forth across the pan until they are cooked to your liking.
Enjoy!
