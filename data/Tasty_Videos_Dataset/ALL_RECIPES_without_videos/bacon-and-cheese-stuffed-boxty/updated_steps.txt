Peel and grate the raw potato, then wrap in a clean towel and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can.
Put the grated potato into a large bowl and stir in the cooked mashed potato and the flour.
Stir in the melted butter and season if necessary.
Add a bit of milk and stir, then add a bit more milk - keeping doing this until all of the milk is combined into the mixture and you have a somewhat sticky dough, if it’s too wet add a bit more flour.
Dust your hands and work surface in flour and grab a palm sized amount of the mixture, flattening it out to about 1-cm (¼ in) thick.
Spoon some grated cheese and some bacon bits into the center and drop another flattened out dough mixture piece on top.
Cut into a nice round shape using a cookie cutter making sure it’s fully sealed.
NOTE: Try not to make these too thick or they might not cook all the way through, if they are thick, lower the temperature to a low-medium heat instead.
Fry in butter over a medium heat for about 4-6 minutes on each side until golden brown.
Serve topped with a tablespoon of soured cream and a few bits of scallions.
Enjoy!
