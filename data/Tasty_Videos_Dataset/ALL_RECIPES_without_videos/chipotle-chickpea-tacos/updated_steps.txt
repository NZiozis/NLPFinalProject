Add the olive oil to a pan over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chickpeas and cook until slightly golden, stirring occasionally.
Add soy sauce, chipotle chili powder, and garlic powder to the chickpeas and saut√© for 3-4 more minutes, until golden brown.
Serve on warm tortillas with desired taco toppings.
Enjoy!
