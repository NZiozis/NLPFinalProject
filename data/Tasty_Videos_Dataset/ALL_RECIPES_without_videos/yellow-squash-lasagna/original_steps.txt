Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Use a vegetable peeler to peel the yellow squash into ribbons. Add the squash to a large bowl.
Add 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, the garlic powder, onion powder, and 1 teaspoon oregano, and toss well until the squash is coated. Set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 5 minutes, until fragrant.
Add the ground chicken, the remaining teaspoon salt, remaining teaspoon pepper, remaining teaspoon oregano, and the thyme, and cook until chicken is lightly golden brown.
Add the crushed tomatoes, stirring to break up, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, Parmesan, and eggs and whisk until smooth.
Grease a 9x13-inch (22x33 cm) casserole dish with cooking spray.
Spread about ¼ of the ground chicken and tomato mixture in the bottom of the dish. Top with about ¼ of the squash noodles and ⅓ of the cheese mixture. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, finishing with a layer of noodles
Top with the fresh mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is browned and melted.
Serve warm.
