Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Remove the core and thinly slice apples.
Place apple slices in a large bowl and gently mix in sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon.
Set aside.
In another bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, and butter.
Mix until crumbly.
Line a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish with parchment paper and pour ⅔ of the oats mixture in the bottom of the pan, pressing firmly to pack it down to make a crust.
Pour apples over the crust and spread in an even layer.
Pour the remaining oat mixture over the top and spread evenly.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
Cool completely before cutting.
Enjoy!
