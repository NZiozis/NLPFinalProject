Pour mixture onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until smooth for 5 minutes.
Place dough in a large oiled bowl, brush the top of the dough lightly with oil, and let rise for an hour in a warm area.
Punch down the dough and roll out on a floured surface to a rectangular shape about 1 centimeter (½ inch) thick.
Brush the melted butter evenly over the dough until covered.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon.
Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over the dough.
Roll up the dough from the bottom to the top.
Cut the dough into nine even pieces and place them in a 9-inch (23 cm) square baking pan greased with nonstick spray.
Let the dough rise for another hour.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Bake the cinnamon rolls for 30 minutes until toothpick comes out clean.
Release the cinnamon rolls from the pan and place on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
Pour the cream cheese frosting evenly over the top.
Enjoy!
