Combine the chicken with all the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Stir to make sure each piece of chicken is coated evenly, then cover with cling film and chill for about an hour.
Combine all of the breading ingredients in a large bowl, then roll the marinated chicken pieces in the flour, shaking off excess. Repeat with the rest of the chicken.
Heat oil in a skillet over high heat to about 350°F.
Fry 3-4 pieces at a time for about 15-20 minutes until the breading is dark golden brown, flipping several times to ensure the breading cooks evenly and does not burn. The heat of the oil should drop to about 320°F.
Drain the chicken on paper towels or on a wire rack, resting for about 10-15 minutes.
Enjoy!
