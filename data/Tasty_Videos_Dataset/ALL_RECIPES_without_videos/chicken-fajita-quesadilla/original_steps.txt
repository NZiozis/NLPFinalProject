In a large skillet, coat chicken with salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and garlic powder. Cook 5-7 minutes.
Add the peppers and onions and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until they are soft. Remove chicken, onions and peppers from the pan and set aside.
Place the tortilla in the skillet and add a layer of cheese on half of the tortilla.
Add cooked chicken, peppers and onions. Top with more cheese and fold the tortilla in half.
Cook for 6 minutes over medium heat, flipping half way.
Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream on the side.
Enjoy!
