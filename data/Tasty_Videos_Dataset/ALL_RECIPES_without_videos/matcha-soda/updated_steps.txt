In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the simple syrup and matcha.
Simmer for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and let cool completely.
Once the matcha syrup is cool, strain into an airtight glass container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
To make the soda, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of seltzer water into a glass filled with ice and add 1-2 tablespoons of matcha syrup.
Stir to combine.
