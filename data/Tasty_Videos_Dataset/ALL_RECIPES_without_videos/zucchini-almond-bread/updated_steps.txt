Preheated oven at 350ºF (175ºC).
Mix all of the dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, chopped almonds) in a bowl, and set aside.
In a new bowl, combine pineapple, eggs, vegetable oil, sugar, brown sugar, zucchini, and vanilla, and mix well.
Pour the dry ingredients gradually into the wet ingredients bowl, and mix them until smooth.
Spray your baking pan and pour in the mixture, top with sliced almonds.
Bake for 60 minutes (times may vary depending on oven), and check for doneness with a toothpick.
While baking, mix your glaze ingredients together until smooth.
Let the bread cool down, drizzle with the glaze!
Enjoy!
