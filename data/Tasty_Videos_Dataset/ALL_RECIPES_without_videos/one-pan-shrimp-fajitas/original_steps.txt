Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Wrap the tortillas in foil and place on the corner of a baking sheet.
Add the bell peppers, red onion, and shrimp to the sheet and season with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, and lime.
Toss to coat.
Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, flipping the shrimp halfway through.
Serve with warm tortillas, salsa, guacamole, cilantro, and lime.
Enjoy!
