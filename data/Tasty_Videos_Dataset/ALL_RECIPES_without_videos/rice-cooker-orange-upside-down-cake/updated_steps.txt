In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and 100 g (Â½ cup) of the sugar.
Add the eggs and whisk until combined.
Zest one half of the orange over the batter.
Add the lemon juice and whisk to combine.
Add the pancake mix and melted butter, and whisk until the batter is smooth.
Brush the bowl of the rice cooker with melted butter.
Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of sugar on the inside of the bowl so that it is well coated.
Slice the orange into 7 thin slices and lay on the inside of the bowl.
Pour the batter over the oranges, and cook for 40 minutes.
Remove the bowl of the rice cooker and place a plate over the top.
Carefully flip the bowl upside-down so that the cake slides onto on the plate with the orange slices on top.
Enjoy!
