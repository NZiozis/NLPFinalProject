Add enough oil to a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot to come about halfway up the sides. Heat the oil until it reaches 375˚F (190˚C).
Slice the onions ¾-inch (19 cm) thick and separate into individual rings.
Place the original potato chips in a resealable plastic bag and crush into crumbs. Transfer to a shallow bowl and repeat with the sour cream and onion and BBQ chips, adding each flavor to a separate bowl.
Add the flour and eggs to 2 more shallow bowls. To the eggs, add the buttermilk and a pinch of salt and pepper and beat to combine. Add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper to the flour and mix to combine.
With one hand, dredge an onion ring in the flour mixture and gently shake off any excess. With the other hand, dip the onion ring in the egg mixture and let any excess drip off. Dip once more in the flour, then the egg. Dip the onion ring in 1 of the 3 chip flavors, ensuring that the ring is coated thoroughly. Set on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining onion rings, coating about ⅓ of the rings in each chip flavor.
Working in batches, fry the onion rings in the hot oil for 2-3 minutes, until golden brown. Watch carefully, as the onion rings will cook quickly. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
Sprinkle the onion rings with parsley and serve with your favorite dipping sauces.
Enjoy!
