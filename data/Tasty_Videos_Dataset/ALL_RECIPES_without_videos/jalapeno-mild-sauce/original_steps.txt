Heat the olive oil in a large pan over high heat, then add the jalapeños, onion, garlic, and salt. Stir and cook for 4 minutes.
Add the water and vinegar. Reduce the heat to medium-low.
Simmer for 20 minutes stirring continuously.
Remove the pan from the heat and let cool.
Pour the jalapeño mixture into a blender and puree until smooth.
Using a funnel, pour the sauce into a bottle or jar and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.
Enjoy!
