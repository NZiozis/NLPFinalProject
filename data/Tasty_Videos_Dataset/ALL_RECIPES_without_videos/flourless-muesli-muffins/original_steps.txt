Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, thoroughly beat the eggs, then mix in the applesauce, Greek yogurt, milk, maple syrup, and vanilla until evenly combined.
Add 3 cups (240 g) of muesli, the baking powder, and salt. Mix well.
Divide the batter between the muffin cups.
Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of muesli over the tops of the muffins.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Let cool, then serve or store in the fridge for up to a week.
Enjoy!
