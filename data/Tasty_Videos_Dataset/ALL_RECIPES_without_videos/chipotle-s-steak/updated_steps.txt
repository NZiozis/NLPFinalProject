On a cutting board, season the steak with salt and pepper on both sides.
Place the steak in a zip-top bag and add the chipotle peppers, then toss to coat.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to overnight.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the steak to the pan and cook for 5 minutes per side.
Remove the steak from the pan and rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes.
Cut into bite-size pieces.
Enjoy!
