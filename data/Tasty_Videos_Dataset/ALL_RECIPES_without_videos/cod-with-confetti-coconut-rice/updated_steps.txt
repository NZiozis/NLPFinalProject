In a medium saucepan, combine the rice, bell pepper, carrots, jalapeño, 2 teaspoons salt, Thai Kitchen coconut milk, and water, then stir to combine.
Turn the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.
Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 10–12 minutes or until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed.
In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
Once the oil is almost smoking, lay each fillet in the pan.
Sear until fish releases from pan with ease and is golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Using a fish spatula, flip each fillet and sear on the other side until cooked through, about 3 minutes.
To serve, scoop rice onto each plate and top with a cod fillet.
Serve with lime wedges.
Enjoy!
