Throw the lime wedges, raspberries, mint, and sugar into a glass and then, using a muddler or wooden spoon, press down on the ingredients to mush them all together and get all of the juice out of the lime wedges.
Add ice and pour in rum (you can just eyeball the amount, if you don’t have something handy to measure) and then top the glass off with club soda.
If you want it a little more or less sweet, you can always add slightly more or slightly less sugar.
It’s also delicious with less rum, or no rum at all.
Stir well and top with fresh mint.
Enjoy!
