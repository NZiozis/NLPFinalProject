Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Line a 10-inch (25-cm) springform pan with parchment paper.
Carefully slice the zucchini, potatoes, and carrots very thinly with a mandoline or a sharp knife. Watch your fingers!
In a large bowl, combine the eggs, melted butter, and milk, and whisk until combined.
Add the nutmeg, basil, thyme, salt, pepper, and flour, and whisk well.
Add the sliced veggies to the batter and stir well until the slices are well-coated.
Add half of the vegetables slices to the prepared pan and flatten with a spoon.
Sprinkle the cheese over the vegetables.
Top with the rest of the vegetables and cover the pan with aluminum foil.
Bake for about 1½ hours, until the vegetables are fully cooked and tender.
Let cool for at least 10 minutes, and release the springform, slice, and serve.
Enjoy!
