Preheat oven to 350˚F/180˚C.
Steam the cauliflower for 8 minutes, or until softened. Let cool and drain.
With a potato masher or hand blender, mash the cauliflower, garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
In a cast-iron pan, heat a little olive oil and sauté the onions and carrots until they begin to soften, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute.
Add the ground turkey, salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary and cook until turkey is browned and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes.
Add flour and stir to combine.
Add the tomato paste and broth while whisking.
Add the peas and corn and cook until hot, about 5 minutes.
In a lined 12-cup muffin tray, evenly portion out the turkey mixture, followed by the mashed cauliflower.
Sprinkle with cheese, as desired.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and has started to brown.
Enjoy!
