In a small bowl, combine water and flax meal, and let it sit for 10 minutes.
In a large saucepan bring 6 cups (1 ½ L) of water to a boil, then add sweet potatoes. Cook until they are tender, about 10 minutes, then drain.
In a food processor, combine the sweet potatoes, chickpeas, basil, flax egg, garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, and flour, and pulse until combined. Add the bread crumbs and mix.
Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Take about 1 tablespoon worth of mixture and form it into a nugget with your hands.
Bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown.
Or, pan fry with a small drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Allow to cool 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
