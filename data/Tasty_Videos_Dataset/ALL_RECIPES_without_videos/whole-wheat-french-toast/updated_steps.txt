Preheat Griddler, fitted with the griddle plates, to 375°F (190°C), and grease with nonstick spray.
Use a whisk to beat the eggs in a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) casserole dish until smooth.
Add the milk, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt, and whisk until smooth and well combined.
Dunk the bread in the batter, 4 slices at a time, until just soaked.
Do not let the bread soak in the wet ingredients too long or it will become too wet and fall apart when you attempt to pick it up.
Transfer the soaked bread to the Griddler and cook for 10 minutes.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar, drizzle with maple syrup, and serve.
Enjoy!
