Combine the cumin, chili powder, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
Rub all over the steak.
Heat a large sauté pan over high heat until very hot. Add a splash of vegetable oil.
Add the steak to the pan and cook 3-4 minutes per side for medium, or cook to desired doneness.
Remove from pan and let rest at least 10 minutes.
Thinly slice against the grain.
Preheat an oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Place the flour tortillas on baking sheets. Sprinkle each with a small amount of shredded cheese, then place one hard taco shell inside.
Heat just until cheese melts, about 3-5 minutes.
Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add butter. Scramble the eggs and season with salt and pepper.
To assemble, fill each double-decker shell with a few spoonfuls of scrambled eggs and a few slices of steak. Top with salsa, avocado, queso fresco, cilantro, and scallions.
Enjoy!
