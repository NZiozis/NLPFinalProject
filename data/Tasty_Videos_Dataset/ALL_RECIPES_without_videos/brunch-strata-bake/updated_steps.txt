Whisk together eggs, milk and salt and pepper.
Add the cubed crusty bread, stir and let the bread soak up all the egg mix.
Oil a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) pan, put down ½ of the soaked bread, add ham, spinach and cheese.
Top with the rest of the bread.
If you need to, pat down the strata with your spoon or spatula.
Sprinkle more cheese over the top.
Bake in preheated oven at 350°F (177°C) for 45 minutes.
Enjoy!
