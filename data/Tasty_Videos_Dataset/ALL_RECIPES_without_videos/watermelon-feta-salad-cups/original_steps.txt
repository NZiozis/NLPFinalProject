Cut the watermelon into 1Â½-inch (4 cm) cubes, removing the rind.
Using a teaspoon measuring spoon or a melon baller, scoop out the center of each watermelon cube, only going about halfway through.
In a large bowl, combine the cucumber, feta, mint, olive oil, and salt.
Spoon the cucumber mixture into the watermelon cubes.
Garnish with more mint. Chill until serving.
Enjoy!
