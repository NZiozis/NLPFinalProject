Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
On a cutting board, split the bell peppers in half from stem to base.
Cut out the stem and the seeds.
Transfer halved peppers to a baking tray, cavity side up.
Sprinkle each half with salt and pepper.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until peppers are slightly soft.
Sprinkle the mozzarella and half of the chives evenly among the four pepper halves.
Then crack eggs into the center of each pepper.
Sprinkle the salt, pepper, bacon, cheddar, and remaining chives on top of the eggs.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until egg whites are set.
Serve!
Enjoy!
