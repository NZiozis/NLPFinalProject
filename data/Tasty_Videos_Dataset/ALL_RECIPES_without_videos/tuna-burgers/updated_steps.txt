Combine the tuna, olive oil, panko, parsley, chives, garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, and egg in a large bowl until evenly mixed.
Divide the mixture into 4 portions and form patties with your hands.
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Place the patties in the pan and cook for 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
Serve on whole wheat buns with your preferred toppings.
Enjoy!
