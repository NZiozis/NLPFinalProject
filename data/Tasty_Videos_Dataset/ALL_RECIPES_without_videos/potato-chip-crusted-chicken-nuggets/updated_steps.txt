Smush the crisps into little bits.
Cut the chicken breast into small bite sized chunks.
One at a time, add a piece of chicken to the bag and shake it around a bit.
Squeeze to help the the crisps stick to the chicken.
Continue until you have either run out of chicken or crisps! (don’t eat any leftover crisps that have come into contact with the raw chicken).
Place the coated chicken onto a baking tray.
Bake in the centre of a pre-heated oven for 12 minutes at 200°C/400°F
Serve with ketchup, mayo or whatever you like!
Enjoy!
