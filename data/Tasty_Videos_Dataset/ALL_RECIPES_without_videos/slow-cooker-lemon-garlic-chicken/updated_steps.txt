Place the chicken, salt, pepper, oregano, rosemary, and thyme into the slow cooker and mix together with your hands.
Add the garlic, lemon, and water.
Place the lid on and cook on high for 3 hours.
Remove the chicken, lemon, and garlic, and stir in the chicken stock and cornflour mix.
Stir until you reach your desired consistency for chicken gravy.
Pour the gravy over the chicken and serve with vegetables.
Enjoy!
