Bring a pot of water to a rapid boil.
Gently lower the eggs into the water and cover.
Cook the eggs for exactly 6 minutes for soft-boiled eggs, 8 minutes for medium-boiled eggs, and 11 minutes for hard-boiled eggs.
Once time has elapsed, scoop out the eggs and immediately transfer to an ice bath to chill.
Peel the eggs.
Enjoy!
