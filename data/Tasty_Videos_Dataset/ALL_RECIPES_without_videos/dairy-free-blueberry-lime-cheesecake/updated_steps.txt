The night before you intend to make your “cheesecake,” place cashews in a bowl of water and let soak overnight.
To make the crust, add walnuts, almonds, dates, vanilla extract, water and salt to a food processor or blender and pulse until sticky mounds begin to form.
Press the crust into a 7-inch (18 cm) springform pan lined with parchment paper.
Drain the cashews well and add to the food processor.
Blend until smooth.
Scrape down the sides of the processor and add lime juice, maple syrup, vanilla extract and lime zest.
Blend until smooth, adding the coconut oil half way.
Spread about ⅓-½ of the mixture on top of your crust to make the first layer.
Freeze for 30 minutes to set.
Add blueberries to the remaining cashew mixture and blend until combined.
Spread the rest of the mixture onto the cheesecake and garnish with fresh lime zest and blueberries.
Cover with foil and freeze for 3 hours to set, then transfer to the fridge.
Enjoy!
