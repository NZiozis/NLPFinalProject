Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat, then add the garlic and onion and sauté for 1-2 minutes, until the onion is translucent.
Add the potato, celery, carrot, salt, and pepper. Sauté for 3 minutes.
Add the butternut squash, broth, water, bay leaf, and thyme and stir. Bring to a boil.
Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 25-30 minutes.
Remove the thyme stems and bay leaf.
Use an immersion or countertop blender to blend the soup until smooth.
Let cool for 2 minutes, then serve.
Enjoy!
