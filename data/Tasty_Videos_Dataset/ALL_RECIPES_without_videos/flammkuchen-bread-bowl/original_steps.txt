Preheat oven to 480°F/250˚C.
Fry the bacon and the onions in a pan.
Mix fried onions, bacon, and sour cream in a bowl and season with pepper.
Cut off the top of the bread and remove the inside with a spoon.
Fill the bread with the sour cream mixture and cover with gruyère cheese.
Spread butter on the leftover bread, cut into thick chunks, and place on a baking tray together with the bread bowl.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the bread is crispy and the cheese golden brown.
Enjoy!
