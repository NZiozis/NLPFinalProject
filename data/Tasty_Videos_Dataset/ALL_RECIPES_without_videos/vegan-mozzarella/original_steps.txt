Bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the cashews and boil for 30 minutes, then drain.
Add the boiled cashews, non-dairy yogurt starter, xanthan gum, and water to a blender. Blend until smooth.
Transfer the “cheese” mixture to a large bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let sit at room temperature, or between 72º-90ºF (22˚-32˚C), for 12-16 hours.
Return the mixture to the blender. Add the salt, apple cider vinegar, agar agar flakes, tapioca starch, and coconut oil. Blend until smooth.
Fill a large bowl with water and salt generously. Stir to dissolve the salt, then add ice. Set aside.
Transfer the “cheese” mixture to a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir constantly until the mixture begins to pull together, 3-5 minutes.
Using an ice cream scoop, scoop golf ball to baseball-size pieces of the mixture into the ice water. Allow the “mozzarella” balls to sit for 30 minutes, until they have firmed up and become stretchy.
Store in salt water in the fridge for up to 1 week.
Enjoy!
