In a large saucepan over medium heat–melt the butter.
Add the marshmallows and food coloring–stirring constantly–until the marshmallows have melted.
Remove from heat and fold in corn flakes until all the cereal is coated.
Drop onto wax paper until cool enough to touch (but still warm).
Form cooled/warm clusters into wreaths and finish by pressing in cinnamon candies to decorate.
Enjoy!
