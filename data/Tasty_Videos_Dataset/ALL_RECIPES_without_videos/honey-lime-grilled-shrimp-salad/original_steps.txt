Dressing: Place all the ingredients in a food processor. Process for about 1 minute until emulsified. Set aside.
Heat grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Place shrimp skewers and the corn on the grill and close the lid. Grill for 4 minutes, then flip skewers. Grill for 3 minutes on the second side, then take the skewers off the grill. Rotate corn to get light grill marks. (Corn will take about 5 minutes longer than the shrimp.) Take the corn off the grill.
Pull the shrimp off the skewers. Slice corn off the cob.
Assemble the salad: On a platter, arrange the mixed baby greens. Scatter the tomatoes, radishes, and avocado on top. Add the shrimp and corn. Scatter sliced scallion over the salad. Drizzle with the dressing. Serve!
Enjoy!
