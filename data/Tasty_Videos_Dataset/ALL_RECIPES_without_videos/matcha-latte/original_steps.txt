Add the matcha to a mug and pour in the hot water and agave.
Whisk with a small whisk or a matcha whisk, until tiny bubbles form on the surface.
Froth the milk by adding it to a resealable jar. Shake vigorously until many bubbles form. Then, microwave the milk for 45 seconds to 1 minute, which will help create stable bubbles.
Pour the milk into the tea.
Dust the top with more matcha, if desired.
Enjoy!
