In a large bowl, crumble the cake into fine uniform crumbs. Add the vanilla frosting and mix thoroughly.
Press the cake mixture into an ice cube tray. Dip the lollipop sticks into 2 tablespoons of melted white chocolate, then stick them into the center of each cake pop inside the ice cube tray.
Freeze for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours.
Use a butter knife or offset spatula to loosen the cake pops from the ice cube tray. Pull out the cake pops.
Dip each cake pop in the remaining melted white chocolate. Decorate with sprinkles
Enjoy!
