In a large pot, boil water and add pasta. Cook (stirring frequently) until al dente.
Drain and set pasta aside.
In the same pan, heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. Add garlic and crushed red pepper, cook until fragrant.
Toss in shrimp, salt and pepper to taste, and stir until shrimp start to turn pink, but are not fully cooked.
Add oregano and spinach, cook until wilted.
Return cooked pasta to the pot, add remaining butter, parmesan, and parsley. Stir until well mixed and the butter is melted.
When the shrimp are cooked, add lemon juice, mix once more, then serve while hot.
Enjoy!
