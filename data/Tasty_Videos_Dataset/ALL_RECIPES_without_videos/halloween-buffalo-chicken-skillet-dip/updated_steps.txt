Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a bowl, combine chicken, cream cheese, monterey jack, cheddar, buffalo sauce, and ranch.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out one can of pizza dough.
Cut out triangles for eyes, and a mouth.
Bake for 12 minutes, or until the pieces are golden brown, slightly risen and cooked through.
Cut the remaining dough into 16 squares, place a cube of cheese on each one, and roll into balls.
Place in a ring around the edges of a greased oven-safe skillet or dish.
Fill the middle of the dish with the dip filling.
Bake for 35 minutes.
Coat all of the dough with melted butter.
Place the dough face pieces on the dip.
Enjoy!
