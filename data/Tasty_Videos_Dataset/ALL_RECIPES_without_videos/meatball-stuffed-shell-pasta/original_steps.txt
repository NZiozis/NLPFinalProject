In a medium bowl, mix together the beef, pork, bread crumbs, onion, Parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, eggs, salt, and pepper until just combined.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Take a walnut-sized portion of the meat mixture and roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining meat and transfer to an oiled wire rack set over a baking sheet.
Bake the meatballs for 10 minutes, until golden brown.
Make the ricotta-herb mixture: combine the ricotta cheese, basil, parsley, Parmesan cheese, and salt in a medium bowl and mix well.
Stuff a tablespoon of ricotta mixture into a jumbo shells, then stuff a meatball into the shells.
Spread the marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) casserole dish, then lay in the stuffed shells. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
Bake for 10 minutes, until the marinara sauce is warm.
Top with chopped basil.
Enjoy!
