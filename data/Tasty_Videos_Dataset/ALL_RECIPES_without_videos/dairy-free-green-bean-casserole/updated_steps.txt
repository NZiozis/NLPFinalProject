Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Bring a small pot of water to a boil, then place a strainer over the top.
Add the green beans to the strainer, cover, and steam for 10-15 minutes, or until fork-tender.
Set aside.
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion.
Cook for 2 minutes, or until semi-translucent.
Add the mushrooms and cook for 5-6 minutes, until they have released the majority of their juices.
Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the garlic, and soy sauce.
Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant.
Stir in the flour to make a roux, then season with salt and pepper.
While stirring continuously, pour in the non-dairy milk and bring to a boil.
Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the sauce has thickened.
Stir in the green beans and ½ cup (75 g) of the fried onions, until combined.
Transfer to a medium baking dish and sprinkle on the remaining cup of fried onions.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until bubbling.
Serve warm.
Enjoy!
