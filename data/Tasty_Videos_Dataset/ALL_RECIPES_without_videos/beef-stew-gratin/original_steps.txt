Preheat oven to 180°C (350˚F).
Add salt and pepper to the flour and use it to coat the diced beef. Brown off beef in a deep ovenproof pan with olive oil. Remove from pan.
Add more oil and fry the onions until translucent. Add the carrots and celery and fry for another 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic and fry for 2 minutes together with the beef.
Add in the tomato puree and rosemary and fry for a further 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped tomato and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the red wine and allow to reduce slightly. Add the beef stock and allow to reduce for 10 minutes.
Cover the pot with a lid and cook for 2 hours.
Remove and cover the top of the stew with thinly-chopped peeled potatoes, arranged so they are overlapping slightly.
Cover with melted butter, salt, pepper, and thyme and cook for a further 45 minutes at 200°C (400˚F) with the lid off.
Remove from oven once potatoes are cooked and cover with the grated gruyere. Grill on high for 5-10 minutes until cheese is bubbling.
Enjoy!
