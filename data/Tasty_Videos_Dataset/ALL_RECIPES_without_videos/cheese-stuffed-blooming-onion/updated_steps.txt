Cut just the top off an onion and place it cut-side down.
Using a sharp knife, go around the root of the onion and make 4 evenly spaced cuts, being careful not to cut all the way through.
Go back around and make 2 additional cuts between each quarter.
Flip the onion over and coax apart its layers (or “petals”).
Place 2 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of each other, cut them into ½-inch (1 cm) slices, then cut them in half.
Place a piece of cheese in between all of the onion petals.
Freeze the onion for 1 hour.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk and the eggs.
In large bowl, whisk together the flour, garlic salt, black pepper, and paprika.
Place the onion in the wet mixture, turning it until every petal is coated.
Place the onion in the dry mixture, coating every petal.
Coat the onion in the egg wash and dry mixture one more time.
Place onion in the freezer for 20 minutes.
Heat canola oil to 375ºF (190ºC) in a deep-fryer or Dutch oven.
With tongs, add the onion to the oil for 2 minutes or until it is browned and crispy on all sides.
Move onion to plate covered in paper towels and allow to drain for 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
