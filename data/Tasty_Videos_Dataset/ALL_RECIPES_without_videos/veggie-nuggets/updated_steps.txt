In a food processor, blend carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, garlic, egg, onion powder, salt, and pepper until combined.
Add 1¼ cup (145 grams) of bread crumbs and blend just until incorporated.
Scoop a tablespoon of the mixture and form a small circular-shaped “nugget.”
Place the remaining ½ cup (60 grams) of bread crumbs in a bowl and cover each nugget with the bread crumbs.
Pan fry with a small drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Or, you can bake them on a piece of parchment paper at 400˚F (200˚C) for 25 minutes, flipping after the first 15 minutes.
Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
