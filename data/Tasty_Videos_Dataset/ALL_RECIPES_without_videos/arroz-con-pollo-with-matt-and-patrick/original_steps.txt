Add the chicken thighs to a large pot, cover with water, and season with salt. Boil the chicken for 40 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain.
Shred the chicken from the bones and set aside.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, then add the rice and continually stir until the rice turns a light brown.
Add the garlic, onion, and salt. Stir the rice until it turns golden.
Add the tomato sauce, bouillon cubes and hot water. Increase the heat to medium-high.
Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the liquid. Check occasionally to make sure the rice is not drying out too quickly.
Mix in the shredded chicken, peas, and carrots.
Remove the rice from the heat and fluff with fork.
Enjoy!
