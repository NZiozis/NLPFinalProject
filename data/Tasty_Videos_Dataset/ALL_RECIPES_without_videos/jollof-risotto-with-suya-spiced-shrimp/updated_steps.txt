Make the stew: In a blender, combine the tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, and habanero.
Blend until smooth.
Pour the tomato puree into a medium pot set over medium-high heat.
Add the bay leaf.
Bring to boil and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the water has cooked off and the sauce is reduced by about half.
Add the vegetable oil and fry the sauce for 10-15 minutes more.
Add the thyme and curry powder, then crumble in the Maggi cubes.
Cook for another 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat and set aside.
Make the risotto: Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.
Add the onion and cook for 3-5 minutes, until softened.
Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste is deep brick-red in color, about 5 minutes.
Add the rice and saut√© until well-coated with the tomato oil.
Deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce until the pan is almost dry.
Add 1 ladle of hot stock to the rice.
Stir the rice until the stock is absorbed and the pan is almost dry.
Continue adding stock, 1 ladle at a time, until the rice is tender, but still firm.
It should be moist and creamy, but not runny.
Add the stew and stir to incorporate.
Remove the risotto from the heat, then season with salt and stir in the butter, then stir until melted and well incorporated.
Remove the risotto from the heat.
Make the shrimp: In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with the suya spice until well coated.
Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat.
Add the garlic and prawns and cook, flipping once, until the prawns are pink and opaque, 4-5 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle the shrimp with the parsley.
Divide the risotto between 2 warm serving plates.
Top with the shrimp and serve with fried plantains alongside.
Enjoy!
