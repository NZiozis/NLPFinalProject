Add coconut butter and maple syrup to a saucepan over medium heat.
Cook for 2-3 minutes while stirring constantly. The mixture should start out smooth then thicken into a dense paste.
Add peanut butter and vanilla extract to the saucepan and stir to incorporate. Continue to cook for an additional 2-4 minutes until the mixture achieves a smooth and pourable texture.
Remove the peanut butter mixture from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.
While the mixture cools, break up the baking bar of chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it for 1 minute (stirring every 15 seconds) or until it is completely melted and smooth.
Prepare a 9x9-inch (23x23 cm) baking tray by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray and layering it with a piece of parchment paper.
Pour half of the peanut butter mixture into the baking tray and spread it out evenly.
Add the melted chocolate to the remaining peanut butter mixture and mix thoroughly.
Once incorporated, layer the chocolate mixture into the baking tray, over top of the peanut butter layer, and spread it evenly.
Give the tray a few shakes and taps to remove any possible air bubbles and place the tray in the freezer for 1.5-2 hours to set.
Turnover the baking tray to remove the fudge. Cut into small rectangular pieces before serving.
NOTE: Fudge should be stored in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Enjoy!
