Preheat oven to 350°F (180˚C).
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine cheddar cheese, bacon, chives, salt, and pepper.
Spoon cheese mixture into a greased mini muffin tin.
Bake for 5-8 minutes or until cheese is melted and edges are slightly brown.
Cool on cooling rack or paper towel for 10 minutes.
Enjoy!
