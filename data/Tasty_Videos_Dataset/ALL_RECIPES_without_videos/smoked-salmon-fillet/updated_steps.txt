In a medium bowl, soak the wood chips in the water for 2-3 hours.
Drain the chips and transfer to a medium cast iron pan.
Place a piece of parchment paper over the wood chips.
Season the salmon with Old Bay Seasoning.
Place the salmon on top of the parchment paper and cover the pan with aluminum foil.
Cook over medium-high heat for 10-12 minutes, until an instant read thermometer inserted in the center of the fish reads 145˚F (63˚C).
Enjoy!
