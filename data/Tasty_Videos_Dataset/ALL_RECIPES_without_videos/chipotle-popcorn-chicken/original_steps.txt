Cut chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and place them in a medium-sized bowl.
Pour buttermilk and can of chiles over the chicken, making sure to get all of the adobo sauce out of the can. Mix well to incorporate.
Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours.
In a separate bowl, mix together panko bread crumbs, chili powder, salt, pepper, and paprika.
Remove chicken from the refrigerator and dredge the pieces in the bread crumb mixture for an even coat.
Fry them in 350˚F (180˚C) oil until they are crispy and golden brown (about 2 minutes).
Drain on paper towels.
Garnish with an additional sprinkle of smoked paprika and serve.
Enjoy!
