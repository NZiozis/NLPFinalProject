Using cupcake liners in a muffin tin, fill each with four to five raspberries.
Top with a scoop of rainbow sherbet.
Freeze until ready to serve (best if frozen for at least two hours).
In a large pitcher, mix together the juice concentrates, raspberries, and vodka.
Just before serving, mix in the ginger ale.
Remove a sherbet scoop from the cupcake liner and place in a large mug.
Fill halfway with punch.
Finish with champagne.
Garnish with fresh mint.
Enjoy!
