Use a vegetable peeler to peel the cucumbers.
On a cutting board, cut and discard the ends. Then cut the cucumbers in half. Scoop out the seeds and discard.
Spread the pesto on both sides of the prepared cucumber.
Fill one side of the cucumber with mozzarella and the other with tomatoes, and close the sandwich.
Enjoy!
