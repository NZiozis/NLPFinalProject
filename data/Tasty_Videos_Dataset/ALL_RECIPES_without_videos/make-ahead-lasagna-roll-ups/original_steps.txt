Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Cook lasagna noodles al dente.
In a skillet over medium heat, cook beef, sausage, onion, salt, and pepper until fully cooked.
Add spinach and 1 cup of marinara sauce, and let simmer. Remove from heat.
In a bowl, combine ricotta, Italian seasoning, and egg.
Spread mixture over each lasagna noodle, then top with meat mixture. Roll up tightly and place in a disposable casserole dish.
Let cool completely, then freeze up to 4 days.
To bake, let thaw in the refrigerator during the day.
Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Top with remaining 2 cups of marinara, cover tightly, and bake for 40 minutes.
Uncover, and top with mozzarella and parmesan. Broil an additional 5 minutes or until cheese is melted to your preference.
Enjoy!
