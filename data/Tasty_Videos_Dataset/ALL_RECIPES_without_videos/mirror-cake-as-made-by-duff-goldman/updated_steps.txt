Bloom gelatin by mixing gelatin into cold water and letting it sit for at least 5 minutes.
Heat granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water on a stove top to a boil.
In a bowl, combine the white chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and solidified gelatin.
Pour the hot sugar mixture over the chocolate, condensed milk, and gelatin.
Cover with a cloth until chocolate is soft.
Mix thoroughly until all chocolate is completely melted.
Add desired color and titanium dioxide to the hot mixture.
Mix until there are no air bubbles.
Let mixture cool to 90°F (33°C), then pour over the frozen cake.
Note, this recipe works best on a cake covered in a frozen mousse, but will also work with a cake covered in frozen buttercream frosting.
Enjoy!
