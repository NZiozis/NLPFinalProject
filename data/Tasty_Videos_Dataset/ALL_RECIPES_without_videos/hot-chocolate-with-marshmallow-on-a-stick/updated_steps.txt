In a saucepan set over medium heat, warm the heavy cream, condensed milk and cocoa powder, and bring to a simmer.
Place chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl, and pour on top the top cream mixture.
Allow to stand for 1 minute before stirring to combine, until thick and smooth.
Using a cookie scoop, spoon the mixture into a silicone mini muffin pan.
Use a butter knife to smooth the tops as needed.
Garnish the tops with the marshmallows.
Insert a popsicle stick into the middle of each.
Freeze for 2 hours, or refrigerate for 4 hours.
To serve, dissolve a stick into a mug of hot milk.
Enjoy!
