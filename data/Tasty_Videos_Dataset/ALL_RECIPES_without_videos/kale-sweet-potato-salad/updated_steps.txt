Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Add the sweet potatoes to a baking sheet.
Sprinkle with the garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil.
Toss until the sweet potato is well-coated in the spices, then spread out evenly.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until tender.
In a small bowl, add the pumpkin seeds, chili powder, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, and salt, and mix until well-combined.
Spread the pumpkin seeds out on a baking sheet so they’re not touching each other.
Add to the oven with the sweet potato and bake for 10 minutes, stirring halfway through, until toasted.
In a liquid measuring cup, combine the tahini, remaining tablespoon of maple syrup, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
Mix well, then add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until desired consistency is reached.
In a large bowl, drizzle the kale with olive oil.
Massage with your hands until the kale is tender and has reduced in volume by about a third.
Add the quinoa, roasted sweet potatoes, red onion, and pumpkin seeds.
Drizzle with tahini dressing and toss well.
Serve with more dressing if desired.
Enjoy!
