Add mangoes, cucumber, onion, green bell pepper, cilantro, lime juice, champagne vinegar, and salt to a food processor or blender.
While blending, slowly add the olive oil and continue blending until the mixture has reached your desired consistency.
Transfer the soup to a large bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight, to allow the flavors to deepen.
Serve the soup chilled and garnish with a slice of cucumber, a slice of lime, and a sprig of cilantro.
Enjoy!
