Chop dark chocolate into a bowl. Microwave in 15-second intervals, until fully melted.
Slowly fold in Greek yogurt until thoroughly combined.
Chill in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes, until mixture is solid but still formable.
Using a tablespoon, scoop the mixture and use palms to form and roll into balls.
Roll truffles into your favorite toppings. For sprinkles, chopped nuts, and shredded coconut: first dip truffles into melted chocolate for best results.*
Enjoy!
