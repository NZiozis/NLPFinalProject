Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel.
Season with salt and pepper.
In a large skillet set over medium-high heat, add the oil.
When the oil is hot, add the scallops and cook until golden brown on one side, 2-3 minutes.
Gently turn the scallops, and add the butter and garlic to the pan.
Continue to cook, spooning the butter over the scallops until they are cooked through, about 3 minutes more.
Add the white wine, cook another 10 seconds.
Serve with chives.
Enjoy!
