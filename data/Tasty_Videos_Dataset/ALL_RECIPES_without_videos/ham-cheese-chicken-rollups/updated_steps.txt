Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)
Cut about ¾ of the way through the chicken horizontally, making sure not to cut through the other side.
Flip the chicken open and flat.
Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the chicken and pound it flatter using a pot or a pan.
Remove the plastic wrap.
Season with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder, rubbing the seasoning in evenly.
Lay 2-3 slices of ham over the chicken, followed by 4 slices of provolone cheese.
Carefully roll the chicken up.
Transfer the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs into 3 separate bowls.
Dip the chicken roll into the flour, tapping off any excess, and then into the egg, followed by the breadcrumbs.
Place on a baking sheet
Add the broccoli to the baking sheet, mixing it with the olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Make sure to save a little oil to drizzle on top of the chicken.
Bake for 20 minutes.
Slice, then serve!
Enjoy!
