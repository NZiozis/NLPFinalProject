Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C) degrees.
Peel and grate the potatoes, and soak them in ice water. Squeeze out excess water and place potatoes in a bowl.
Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl and mix well.
On a nonstick pan, form patties of the potato mixture with your hands.
Bake for 35-40 minutes or until brown and crispy.
Enjoy!
