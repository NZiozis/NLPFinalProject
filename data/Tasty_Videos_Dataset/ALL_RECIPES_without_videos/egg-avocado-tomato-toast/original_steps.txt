Sliced two cherry tomatoes.
Mash Â½ of 1 avocado with salt. (Use the other half for another toast.)
Prepare bread in a toaster to desired crispiness.
In a pan, fry an egg sunny side up.
Assemble the toast by spreading avocado on the toast, then the tomatoes and topping everything with the egg.
Enjoy!
