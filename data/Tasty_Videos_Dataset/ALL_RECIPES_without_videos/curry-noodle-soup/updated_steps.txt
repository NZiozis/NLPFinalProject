In a large pot, melt the coconut oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.
Add the red curry paste and cook another 2-3 minutes.
Add the coconut milk and stir well until the curry paste is evenly distributed.
Add the vegetable broth and bring to a boil.
Once boiling, add the agave and rice noodles, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the noodles from sticking together.
Add the tofu, broccoli, and bell pepper, and stir to combine.
Cook for 3-5 more minutes, until the noodles are cooked and the broccoli is tender.
Stir in the lime juice and add salt to taste.
Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
