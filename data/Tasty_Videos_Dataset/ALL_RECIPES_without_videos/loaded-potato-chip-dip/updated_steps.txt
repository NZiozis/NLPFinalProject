Combine the sour cream, cream cheese, and ranch seasoning in a large bowl and stir until smooth.
Add in the cheddar cheese and stir until well-blended.
Lastly, add in the crumbled bacon and the green onions and stir.
Top off with extra green onions, bacon, and cheese and serve with potato chips, potato wedges, or fries!
Enjoy!
