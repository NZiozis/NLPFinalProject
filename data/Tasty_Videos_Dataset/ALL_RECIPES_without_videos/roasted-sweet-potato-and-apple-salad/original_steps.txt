Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a measuring cup, add the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, honey, mustard, salt, pepper, and cinnamon and whisk to combine.
Place sweet potatoes and chicken breast on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray and season with olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika.
Bake until chicken is cooked through and sweet potatoes are tender, 15-18 minutes.
Slice the chicken breast.
Toss the sweet potatoes and sliced chicken with the sliced apples, feta, and walnuts and drizzle with vinaigrette.
Enjoy!
