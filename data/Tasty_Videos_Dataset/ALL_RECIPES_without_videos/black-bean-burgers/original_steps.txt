Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a pan. Combine onions, garlic, salt, and pepper and cook until onions are translucent.
Add carrots, cumin, coriander, chili powder, and cayenne pepper until carrots are tender. Remove pan from heat.
In a bowl, mash the beans and then add the contents of the pan along with the soy sauce and quick oats.
Mix and form four patties. Place in freezer for 30 minutes to set.
Cook patties on a pan coated in cooking spray over medium heat, flipping halfway.
Use patties to create your dream veggie burger.
Enjoy!
