Slice the potatoes into wedges.
Place potato wedges in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle potato wedges with shredded cheese and toss again.
In a small bowl, mix salt, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and paprika. Sprinkle seasoning onto potato wedges and toss to coat.
Place potato wedges on a baking sheet with skin-sides-down.
Bake for 40 minutes at 400˚F (200˚C ) until potatoes are fork-tender and golden.
Enjoy!
