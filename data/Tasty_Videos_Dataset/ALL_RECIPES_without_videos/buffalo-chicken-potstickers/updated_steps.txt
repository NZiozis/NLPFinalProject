In a large bowl mix together shredded chicken, celery, carrots, cream cheese, and hot sauce.
To form the potstickers scoop about a teaspoon amount into the center of a wrapper.
Wet your finger and brush the top edge of the wrapper with water.
Fold the wrapper in half and press and crimp the edges to close.
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat.
Place the potstickers seam side up into the hot oil and leave to brown (once placed DO NOT MOVE - you want a nice golden brown on the bottom, right?
).
After about two minutes, or until desired color is reached, add the water and cover the saucepan.
Leave to steam about two more minutes - or until the water has mostly evaporated and the potstickers have steamed.
Uncover, remove from pan and serve with your choice of ranch or blue cheese dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
