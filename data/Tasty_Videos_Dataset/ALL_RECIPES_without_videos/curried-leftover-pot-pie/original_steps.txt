Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) degrees.
In a large stock pot melt butter on medium heat and cook until it just starts to brown. Add cinnamon stick, cloves, and crushed cardamom pods and reduce heat to low. Cook until the spices are fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Strain the spices from the butter and add the spiced butter back into the pot. Turn the heat up to medium and add onion, cook until caramelized.
Add the garlic and saute for a minute until fragrant. Add shredded turkey, peas, carrots, gravy, garam masala, a bay leaf. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Add the heavy cream and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Pour the pot pie filling into a pie pan. Place spoonfuls of mashed potatoes around the pie pan. Place a sheet of puff pastry on top, crimping the edges to seal. Cut slits in the top to for steam.
In a small bowl, beat the egg with the tablespoon of water until totally combined. Brush the egg wash onto the puff pastry.
Bake for 45 minutes, or until pastry is cooked through and golden browned on top. Remove from oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
