Slice the tops off the strawberries to create a flat surface for them to sit on.
Slice the tip off the strawberry to make the hat.
Squeeze some frosting or whipped cream on the strawberry, and replace the tip.
Decorate the rest with a piping bag.
Add the mini chocolate chips for eyes.
Strawberry santas are mischievous, and tend to disappear quickly!
Make enough for family and friends!
Enjoy!
