Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Line a muffin tin with liners and cooking spray.
Prepare cake mix according to its directions.
Fill liners about ¾ of the way up with the cupcake batter.
Bake for about 20-25 minutes. A toothpick should come out dry when inserted.
Allow the cupcakes to cool completely.
In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, mascarpone, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Mix until well combined.
Fold in the mini chocolate chips.
Cut a ½ inch (1.5cm) hole on the tip of a pastry or zip top bag and fill with the cannoli cream.
Cut a circle in the center of each cupcake and press the center down into the bottom, creating a hole.
Fill the cupcake with cannoli cream and use a spiraling motion to create a swirl of the cream on top of the cupcake.
Put the cupcakes in the freezer for about 1 hour or until firm.
Melt the dark chocolate and coconut oil together.
Carefully, dip the tops of the cupcakes into the melted chocolate.
Place in the refrigerator to firm up if need be.
Enjoy!
