In a blender, combine the sweet potato, almond butter, molasses, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, milk, and salt. Blend on high speed for 3 minutes, or until completely smooth.
Transfer the sweet potato mixture to a small saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until just warmed through. Do not boil.
Pour into a mug and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
