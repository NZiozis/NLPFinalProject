In a large bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form.
Add the condensed milk and cocoa powder, then whip until smooth.
Drizzle the dulce de leche on top.
Carefully swirl in the dulce de leche, making sure it is not blended into the cream.
Transfer the mixture to a baking pan or bowl, then freeze.
Serve with more dulce de leche.
Enjoy!
