In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the simple syrup, lemon juice, and basil.
Simmer for 5 minutes, until slightly reduced.
Remove from the heat and let cool completely.
Once the lemon basil syrup is cool, strain into an airtight glass container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
To make the soda, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of seltzer water into a glass filled with ice and add 1-2 tablespoons of lemon basil syrup.
Stir to combine.
Garnish with lime wheels, if desired.
