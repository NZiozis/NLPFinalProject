Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Melt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery, and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the vegetables have softened.
Add the sausage and cook until browned, about 8-10 minutes, breaking the meat up into smaller pieces. Season with the sage and thyme.
Add the stuffing mix and chicken stock. Stir until the bread is no longer dry. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
Place the turkey breast on a cutting board, skin-side down. Cover with plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to about ½-inch (1 cm) thick.
Brush the turkey breast with the Dijon mustard.
Spread the stuffing mixture over the turkey breast in an even layer, about ¼-inch (6 mm) thick. Transfer any extra stuffing to an oven-safe dish.
Starting from a short end, roll the turkey into a log with the skin on the outside. Tuck in any loose bits.
Use kitchen twine to tie the turkey closed crosswise at 1-inch (2-cm) intervals. Tie once lengthwise to seal the ends.
Transfer the trussed turkey to a wire rack set over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with melted butter and season all sides generously with salt and pepper.
Bake the turkey roulade for 45-60 minutes, until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 165°F (75˚C). Bake the leftover stuffing for 20-30 minutes, until lightly browned on top.
Let rest for 15 minutes, then remove the twine, slice, and serve.
Enjoy!
