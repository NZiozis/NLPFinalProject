Peel the Japanese sweet potatoes and cut into bite-size pieces.
Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 300˚F(150˚C).
Fry the sweet potatoes in the hot oil until tender, 4-5 minutes. Remove from the oil and place on a wire rack.
Increase the oil temperature to 350˚F(180˚C). Return the sweet potatoes to the oil and fry until golden brown, 1-2 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack.
In a medium pan, combine the sugar and corn syrup. Stir until thick and amber in color, 4-5 minutes.
Add fried sweet potatoes to the sugar mixture and toss to coat well.
Enjoy!
