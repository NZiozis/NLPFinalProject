In a medium bowl, combine the ground chicken, bread crumbs, egg, Parmesan, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well, then form into 1-inch (2 cm) meatballs. You should have 16-18 total.
In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Sear the meatballs on all sides until golden brown, 4-5 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside.
In the same pot, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring occasionally until tender, 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes.
Add the chicken stock and bay leaf. Cover and bring to a boil.
Once boiling, add the orzo and meatballs. Cover and simmer for 7-8 minutes, until the orzo is tender.
Add the Swiss chard, cover, and cook for 2-3 minutes until the chard has wilted.
Add the Parmesan cheese and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the lemon juice.
Ladle into bowls and serve.
Enjoy!
