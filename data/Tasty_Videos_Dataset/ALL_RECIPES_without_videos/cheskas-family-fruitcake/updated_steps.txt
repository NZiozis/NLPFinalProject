Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).
In a small bowl, combine the raisins and sweet red wine.
Let sit for at least 10 minutes, until the raisins absorb some of the wine.
In a medium bowl, use an electric hand mixer to beat the egg whites until medium peaks form.
Set aside.
In a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer to cream together the butter and sugar.
Add the egg yolks and beat until incorporated.
Add the salt to the flour, then gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, beating until just incorporated.
Using a rubber spatula, fold in the soaked raisins, walnuts, and glazed fruit until just combined.
Gently fold in the egg whites.
Transfer the batter to a 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan and smooth the top.
Bake for 2 hours 15 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
Let cool.
Serve immediately or wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 7 days.
Enjoy!
