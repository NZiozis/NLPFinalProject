Thoroughly wash the potatoes and peel the skin off.
Cut into smaller pieces and place in a pot of cold water.
Bring to a boil over medium high heat and allow potatoes to cook until they are soft.
Place softened potatoes into a large bowl.
Mix in sour cream, cumin, salt and pepper, and mash until well combined.
Wrap the tortillas in a damp towel or paper towel and microwave for 15-20 seconds, so they donâ€™t break.
On half of the tortilla, place about one Tbsp.
of the potato mixture and spread it around.
Fold the tortilla in half and repeat with the rest of the tortillas.
Heat one inch of vegetable oil in a pan.
Carefully, place the potato tacos in the pan, allowing them to cook for about two minutes on each side.
Once they have developed a golden color, remove from oil and strain excess oil off on a paper towel.
Serve with your favorite toppings.
Enjoy!
