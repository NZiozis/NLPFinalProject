With a peeler, peel slices of zucchini vertically.
Once you can no longer peel a whole slice of zucchini peel the rest into smaller strips and save for zoodles!

Spread chicken mixture on to a slice of zucchini and roll into a tight spiral.
Place in a greased springform pan and bake for 15 minutes.
