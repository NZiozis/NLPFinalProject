In a large bowl add the ingredients.
Mix well.
In a large skillet, heat a half cup of oil (or until entire skillet is covered with a thin layer) over medium-high heat.
Spoon 2 tablespoons of mixture to form each fritter into the hot oil.
Flip after about a minute and a half or when you can see the edges beginning to brown.
Repeat for other side.
Serve with a dollop of sour cream and chives.
Enjoy!
