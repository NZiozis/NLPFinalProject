Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Finely chop the broccoli florets, and then transfer to a large bowl.
Add the cheddar, cream cheese, ham, onion powder, and mix evenly until combined.
Set aside.
In a bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and paprika, then stir to combine.
Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and slice across horizontally, making sure not to cut all the way through.
Season both sides of the chicken liberally with the spice mix.
Place each chicken breast on a double layer of plastic wrap, then cover with more plastic wrap.
Use a meat pounder to thinly pound the chicken breast and form into a rectangular shape.
Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.
Lay down two of the flattened chicken breasts into a greased loaf pan lined with parchment paper, slightly overlapping them.
Place the ham slices evenly across the bottom and sides, hanging the ham over the sides of the loaf pan.
Spread broccoli mixture evenly on top of the ham, pressing it flat into the edges of the pan.
Fold over the flaps of ham to completely seal the mixture.
Place the third flattened chicken breast on top.
Use a fork to tuck in the edges, creating a seal.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the loaf looks slightly brown and red on top.
Cool the loaf in the pan.
Release any juices from the pan.
Remove the chicken loaf using the parchment paper.
Slice into 1-inch (2-cm) slices, and serve!
Enjoy!
