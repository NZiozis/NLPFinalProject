Preheat oven to 325˚F (170˚C).
Mash bananas in a large bowl.
Add eggs and combine thoroughly.
Then mix in the remaining wet ingredients: greek yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla.
Next, add the whole wheat flour and baking powder and mix until fully incorporated.
Be careful not to over mix.
In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, microwave the chocolate chunks in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until melted and smooth.
Add a large scoop of the banana batter to the bowl of melted chocolate and fold until mixed well.
Pour the banana batter and the chocolate batter alternately into a greased 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) bread pan.
These do not need to be even layers.
Using a knife or a spoon, gently swirl the batters together.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean from the center of the bread.
Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes.
Enjoy!
