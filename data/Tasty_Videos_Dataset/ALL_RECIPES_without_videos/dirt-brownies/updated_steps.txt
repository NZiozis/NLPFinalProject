Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C).
In a large bowl, combine sugar, cocoa powder, and butter.
Stir using a spatula or a wooden spoon.
It will be gritty.
Combine vanilla and 1 egg.
Mix until the egg is fully incorporated.
Then mix in the other egg.
Add flour and salt, and mix into the batter.
Transfer into a baking dish and bake for 20 minutes and let it cool completely.

Enjoy!
