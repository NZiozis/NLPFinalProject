Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Place red bell peppers cut-side down on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the skin blackens.
Remove peppers from the oven and transfer with tongs to a sealable container or bowl.
Cover and let cool for 5 minutes.
Once cool enough to handle, peel the blackened skins from the peppers and place into a blender or food processor.
Discard the skins.
To the blender, add the avocado, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and nutritional yeast.
Blend until smooth, adding more olive oil or seasoning as desired.
Serve either chilled or heated up.
Enjoy!
