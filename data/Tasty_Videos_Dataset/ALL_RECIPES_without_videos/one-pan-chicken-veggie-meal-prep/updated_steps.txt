Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Cut vegetables.
Place each in a separate corner of a baking pan lined with parchment paper.
NOTE: Broccoli and Brussels sprouts cook faster, keep the cuts thicker for those.
Sweet potato and carrots take more time - dice them, or cut them thinner.
Season veggies with olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and garlic.
Season both sides of the chicken with olive oil, salt, pepper, and the remaining rosemary, thyme, and garlic over parchment paper.
Seal parchment paper to keep chicken moist, and place on the center of the baking pan.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, until chicken is fully cooked and veggies are done to your liking.
This meal works great with brown rice, so feel free to add some to your meal prep as well.
Unwrap and slice the chicken.
Separate veggies into each tupperware with chicken.
NOTE: If using plastic tupperware, allow food to cool down first
Can be refrigerated up to 4 days.
Enjoy!
