Cut biscuit dough in half.
Flatten dough.
Spread a teaspoon of pesto in the center of the dough, then place a mozzarella cube on top
Pinch the sides around the cheese so the pesto and cheese are completely encased by the dough.
Place stuffed dough balls in a cast iron pan.
Crush garlic and mix with melted butter.
Brush the garlic butter over each ball.
Bake for 20 minutes at 400˚F (200˚C) or until the dough is golden brown.
Serve warm.
Enjoy!
