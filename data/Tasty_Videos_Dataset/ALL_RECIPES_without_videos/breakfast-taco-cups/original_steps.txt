Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Generously coat a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
Stack the tortillas and cut off the edges so the tortillas are square. Then, quarter the squares so you have 12 small tortilla pieces.
Press a tortilla square into each cup of the prepared muffin tin.
Fill each cup with 1 tablespoon of refried beans, 1 tablespoon of scrambled eggs, and 1 teaspoon of cheese and top with a cherry tomato quarter.
Bake for about 10 minutes, until the edges of the tortillas are golden brown and the cheese has melted.
Garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
