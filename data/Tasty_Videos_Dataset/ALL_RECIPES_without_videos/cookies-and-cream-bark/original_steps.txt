Place the chocolate sandwich cookies inside a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into small chunks.
Add of the crush cookies to the melted white chocolate and mix it together.
Transfer the mixture to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, spreading in an even layer with a spatula.
Sprinkle the remaining cookies over the top.
Drizzle the chocolate over the bark.
Freeze for at least 1 hour.
Remove the bark from the freezer and break it into pieces.
Enjoy!
