Melt chocolate and water together in a pan on a low heat, stirring occasionally until melted.
Add ice and water to a large bowl, then place the mixing bowl in the ice water.
Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the mixing bowl in the ice bath.
Using a hand blender, whisk chocolate mixture until it becomes fluffy and resembles whipped cream, do not over mix!
Top with whipped cream and grated chocolate. Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
