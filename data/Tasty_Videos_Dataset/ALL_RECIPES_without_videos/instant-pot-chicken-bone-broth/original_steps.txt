To a 6-quart (5.5 liter) instant pot, add the chicken bones, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, rosemary, thyme, peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and water, and stir to combine. Set the instant pot to high sauté and bring to a boil. Cook until any impurities foam to the surface, then carefully skim off the top with a large spoon.
Place the lid on the pot and turn the venting valve to “sealing.” Set to pressure cooking for 60 minutes.
Release the pressure from the instant pot by switching the vent to “venting.” The hot steam will come out of the top, so make sure your hand is not over the release switch . Wait for the pressure to release and the instant pot to unlock before removing the lid.
Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth. Let cool completely before storing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 6 days, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.
Enjoy!
