Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Cut carrots into fries and combine in a large bowl with olive oil, parsley, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper in a single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway.
Prepare dip while fries are baking. Combine all dip ingredients in a small bowl and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Enjoy!
