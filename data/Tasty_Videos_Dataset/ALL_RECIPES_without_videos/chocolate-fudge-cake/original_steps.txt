In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, vanilla, egg, and oil until smooth.
Add the chocolate cake batter to a mini frying pan over low heat, and spread to smooth the top.
Cover with a small plate and cook for 30 minutes, or until the cake is set.
Serve with powdered sugar and berries (optional).
Enjoy!
