Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Make the muffin batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt with a fork.
In a separate large bowl, combine the applesauce, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla, and vegetable oil. Mix with a fork, then gradually incorporate the dry ingredients until the batter is thick and smooth.
Make the cheesecake filling: In a medium bowl, use a fork to mix together the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fluffy and smooth.
Grease a 2 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
Scoop about ¼ cup (30 g) of muffin batter into each cup. Add a teaspoon of cheesecake filling to the center of each cup. Use a toothpick to swirl the cheesecake into the batter.
Bake for 18 minutes, or until the muffins are springy and lightly browned around the edges.
Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
