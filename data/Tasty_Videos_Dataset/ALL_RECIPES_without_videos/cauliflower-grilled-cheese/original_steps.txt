Grate a cauliflower over a large bowl.
Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the grated cauliflower and mix evenly. Leave to sit for 20 minutes.
Pour the cauliflower into a clean kitchen towel and wring the water out.
In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower, and remaining ingredients, (except your cheese and toppings) stir until well mixed.
Using a spoon transfer two hearty scoops of mixture to form each “bread slice” onto a skillet on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, each side.
Add your cheese and any other toppings, allow a couple minutes for cheese to melt.
Enjoy!
