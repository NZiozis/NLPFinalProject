Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Roll out a circle of pie dough and cut in half.
Press the dough into two small tart tins, and remove any excess dough.
Use a fork to prick the base of the pie dough.
Bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 425˚F (220˚C), or until the tart is golden brown.
Remove from the oven and cool completely.
Add the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and whisk to combine.
Pour in milk and egg yolks and whisk, until the mixture just barely comes to a boil and becomes thick like pudding, about 6-8 minutes.
Stir in the butter and vanilla, and remove the saucepan from the heat.
In three separate microwave-safe bowls, melt each of the chocolates by microwaving for intervals of 15 seconds, stirring until smooth.
Pour the pudding into each of the separate bowls of melted chocolate.
Stir until they are well combined and silky.
Spoon many small dollops of each chocolate pudding into the pie crust.
Make any design you would like with a toothpick.
Chill in the fridge for 2 hours, until set.
Garnish with fresh fruit, or mint
Enjoy!
