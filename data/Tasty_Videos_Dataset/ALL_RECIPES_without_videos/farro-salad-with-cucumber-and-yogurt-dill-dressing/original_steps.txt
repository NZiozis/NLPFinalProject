Rinse the farro and add it to a medium saucepan. Add water until the farro is covered. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 25 minutes, until the farro is tender
While the farro cooks, seed and chop the cucumber. Add it to a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 15-20 minutes. Rinse the cucumbers in cold water and drain well.
Dice the tomatoes.
Make the dressing: Add the yogurt, lemon juice, oil, pepper, parsley, and dill to a large bowl and stir to combine.
Add the farro, cucumbers, tomatoes, and scallions to the bowl with the dressing and toss to coat. Sprinkle with parsley.
