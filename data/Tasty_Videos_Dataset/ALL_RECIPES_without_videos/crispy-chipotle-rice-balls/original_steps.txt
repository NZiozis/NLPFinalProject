In a pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onions and peppers, and cook until translucent.
Add garlic and rice, and cook until fragrant.
Add white wine, stirring frequently.
Slowly add hot chicken broth ½ cup at a time, stirring frequently for about 20 minutes, or until rice is al dente.
In a small bowl, combine chipotle powder, garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, smoked paprika, pepper, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper.
Add half of spice mixture to rice.
Remove rice from heat. Mix in corn and cheese blend.
Cool until room temperature, then chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
While mixture is chilling, place avocados, Greek yogurt, cilantro, lime juice, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a food processor and blend until smooth.
Place flour, eggs and bread crumbs in three separate bowls. Lightly beat eggs and add remaining spice mixture to bread crumbs.
Drop a heaping spoonful of mixture into the flour. Coat with flour and shape it to about the size of a golf ball. Coat with egg, then dip in bread crumbs.
In a skillet, heat oil to 350°F (180˚C).
Add well-coated rice balls to hot skillet.
Fry for about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
