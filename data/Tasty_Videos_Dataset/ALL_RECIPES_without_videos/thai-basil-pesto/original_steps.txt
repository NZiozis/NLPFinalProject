Place the Thai basil, garlic, peanuts, sesame oil, rice vinegar, red pepper flakes, agave nectar, soy sauce, and lime juice in the bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Add salt to taste.
Use pesto immediately or transfer to an airtight container. Pesto can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
Enjoy!
