On a cutting board, thoroughly blot the prime rib with paper towels to absorb any moisture.
Generously season the prime rib all over with salt and pepper.
Place the prime rib in dish with tall sides and set in the refrigerator uncovered to rest for at least 2-4 hours, or overnight.
Transfer the prime rib to a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan and let come to room temperature for 1 hour before roasting.
Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Roast the prime rib for 30 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 325˚F (160˚C).
Continue roasting the rib for 11 minutes per pound, until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 120˚F-125˚F (45-50˚C), for medium rare.
Remove the rib from the oven, tent with foil, and let rest for 30 minutes.
Transfer the roast to a cutting board and carve.
Enjoy!
