Prepare the chicken by removing the backbone using a pair of kitchen scissors or a sharp knife. Turn it over and flatten it down to spread the chicken out as much as possible.
Blend together all of the other ingredients in a food processor and spread it over the chicken as much as possible.
Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 3 hours or overnight.
Bake in the center of a preheated oven, uncovered for 45-50 minutes at 400째F (200째C), or until the thickest part of the thigh is 320째F (160째C)
Allow to rest for 10 minutes.
Enjoy!
