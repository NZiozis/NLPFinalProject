In a blender, combine the apple, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, maple syrup, and milk. Blend on high speed for 3 minutes, or until completely smooth.
Transfer the apple mixture to a small saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until just warmed through. Do not boil.
Pour into a mug and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
