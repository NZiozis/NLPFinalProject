Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
To make the flax eggs, mix together the flax meal and water in a small bowl. Let sit for at least 10 minutes to set.
In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, flax eggs, and almond extract until well-combined.
Sift in the flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and stir with a spatula until combined.
Fold in the oats, cranberries, and sliced almonds until incorporated.
Use an ice cream scoop to scoop the cookies onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches (5 cm) apart.
Bake for 20-22 minutes, until lightly golden around the edges.
Enjoy!
