Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Add the zucchini, sweet potato, tomatoes, onion, and corn to the baking sheet.
Drizzle with the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then season with garlic salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly, keeping the vegetables separate on the pan.
Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until fork tender.
Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large bowl, and add the quinoa. Toss well.
In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and apple cider vinegar. Pour over the veggies and quinoa, and toss to coat.
Garnish with parsley.
Enjoy!
