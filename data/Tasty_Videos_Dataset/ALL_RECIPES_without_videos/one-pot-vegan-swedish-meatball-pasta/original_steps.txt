In a large bowl, combine the mushrooms, beans, onion, bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, dried rosemary, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, nutmeg, liquid smoke, salt, and pepper. Mix well with a fork, mashing the beans a bit to form a paste.
Heat the canola oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Roll the “meatball” mixture and into golf ball-sized balls. Place the balls in the pot and cook for 1 minute on each side until browned.
Add the vegetable broth, coconut milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and flour, and gently stir until evenly combined.
Bring the liquid to a boil, then add the pasta. Stir constantly until the pasta is cooked and the liquid has reduced to a sauce that coats the noodles and meatballs, 7-8 minutes.
Garnish with parsley.
Enjoy!
