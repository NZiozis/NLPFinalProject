Cook the bacon in a large pot until crispy.
Add the shrimp, salt, and pepper.
Cook until the shrimp is pink throughout.
Remove the shrimp and bacon.
Add the onions, tomatoes, and garlic, cooking until the garlic is slightly starting to brown.
Add the cream and bring to a boil.
Toss in the fettuccine with the shrimp, bacon, parmesan cheese, and parsley, stirring until the cheese has completely melted and the sauce coats the shrimp and pasta nicely.
Enjoy!
