Melt butter in a pan over medium heat.
Spread the shrimp around in the pan in a single layer, sprinkling the salt and pepper on top, then cook until the butter is starting to turn a dark brown. Flip the shrimp, add the garlic and chili flakes, and cook for about 15-30 seconds.
Add the parsley and lemon juice, reducing the lemon juice down to a sauce, then remove from heat.
Serve and enjoy!
