In a medium pot, combine the marshmallows and milk.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the marshmallows are completely melted, 5-7 minutes.
Pour the marshmallow mixture over the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl.
Let sit for 2-3 minutes, then whisk until well combined and smooth.
Divide the mixture between 4 serving cups.
Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or until set.
Top with whipped cream and grated chocolate, if desired.
Enjoy!
