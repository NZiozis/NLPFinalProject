Spear each marshmallow with a pretzel stick.
On a hot skillet, melt the bottoms of the chocolate kisses for a few seconds.
Stick the melted part to the marshmallow top.
Let them set for a few minutes until hard.
Melt the white chocolate in the microwave for 1 minute, stirring every 20 seconds until the chocolate is smooth.
Add the blue food coloring and mix thoroughly.
With a spoon, smear the chocolate thickly over the marshmallow sides.
Smooth the sides down with the back of the spoon; wiping away excess.
Set each on wax paper to set.
With a icing tube, or piping bag, decorate them with the Hebrew letters נ ,ג ,ה ,ש.
Enjoy!
