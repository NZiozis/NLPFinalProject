Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Remove the kale leaves from the thick stems, then chop into bite-size pieces. In a medium bowl, top the kale with the olive oil. Mix the seasonings and add to the kale. Toss until fully coated.
Arrange seasoned kale on a baking sheet, ensuring the chips don't overlap. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the edges are brown, but not burnt. Let cool to room temperature.
Enjoy!
