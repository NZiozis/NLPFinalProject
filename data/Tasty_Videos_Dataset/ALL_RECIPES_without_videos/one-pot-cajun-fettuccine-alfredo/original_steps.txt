In a small bowl, combine all spices for the cajun seasoning and mix together. Set aside. Store any extra in an airtight container for future use.
In a heavy bottom pot (such as a Dutch oven), heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
Add the sliced chicken and 2½ tablespoons of the prepared cajun seasoning.
Add the andouille sausage and cook until the chicken is no longer pink, about 4-5 minutes.
Remove the meat from the pot and add the remaining olive oil.
Add the garlic, diced peppers and onions and cook until the onions are transparent and softened, about 5 minutes.
Add the milk and stir so that the seasoning is incorporated into the liquid.
Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil.
Add the uncooked fettuccine, stirring constantly until the noodles are al dente, about 10 minutes.
On low heat, add the meat back in and stir so that it’s evenly incorporated.
Add the cheese and parsley, and stir. Remove from the heat.
Enjoy!
