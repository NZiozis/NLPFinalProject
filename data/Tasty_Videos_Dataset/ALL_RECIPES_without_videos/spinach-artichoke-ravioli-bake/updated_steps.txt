In a large bowl, mix cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts, parmesan cheese, sour cream, milk, and garlic salt (if you want it).
Pour a third of the spinach artichoke mixture in a large glass baking tray and spread it evenly over the bottom.
Line the tray with frozen ravioli, spread more mixture over top the ravioli, then spread the rest of the ravioli in the tray and cover that with remaining mixture.
Bake in the oven at 375ºF (190ºC) for 30–35 minutes or until the bake has browned.
Enjoy!
