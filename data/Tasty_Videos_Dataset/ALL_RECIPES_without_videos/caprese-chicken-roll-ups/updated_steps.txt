Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a saucepan, heat balsamic vinegar and honey over high heat.
Stir until sauce reduces to ⅓ cup (80 ml).
Set aside.
On a cutting board, slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally.
Cover chicken with a piece of plastic wrap.
Using the rough side of a metal mallet, pound the chicken until ½-inch (1 cm) thick.
Repeat with remaining breasts.
Drizzle olive oil over pieces of chicken and season with salt and pepper.
Place 2 slices of mozzarella on each piece of chicken.
Spoon ¼ cup (50 g) of diced tomatoes on each piece of chicken.
Place 3 pieces of basil on each piece of chicken.
Roll up the chicken, making sure the ingredients are tucked under the breast and not pushed out the sides.
Place the roll-ups in a greased baking dish.
Drizzle each roll-up with more olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until internal temperature reaches 160˚F (71˚C).
Place one slice of mozzarella on each roll-up.
Broil for 5 to 10 minutes until the mozzarella has melted over the chicken.
Let chicken rest for 10 minutes.
Place a basil leaf and slice of tomato on each piece of chicken.
Drizzle with balsamic reduction.
Enjoy!
