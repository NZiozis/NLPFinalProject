Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk to combine.
Heat the olive oil in a medium nonstick pan over medium heat until shimmering and add the beaten eggs, salt, and pepper.
Using a rubber spatula, stir the eggs often until firm, roughly 3 minutes.
Divide the eggs between the tortillas.
Top each taco with pico de gallo, black beans, and cilantro.
Enjoy!
