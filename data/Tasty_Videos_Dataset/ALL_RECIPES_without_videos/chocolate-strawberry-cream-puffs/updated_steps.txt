Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Cut the tops off the strawberries and cut into pieces.
Set aside.
In a pot over low heat, combine egg yolks, heavy cream, sugar, and cornstarch.
Turn the heat up to medium-high, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps.
Once the mixture starts to thicken, add in the strawberries, stirring until smooth.
Transfer the cream mixture into a bowl, covering the top with plastic wrap and pressing the wrap down onto the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming.
Chill.
In a pot, combine the water and butter, bringing it to a boil.
Add the flour and stir until the dough comes together in a ball.
Remove from heat.
Add in the vanilla and eggs one a time, stirring until the dough becomes a paste.
Transfer the dough into a piping bag with a large round tip.
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pipe 1-inch (2½ cm) mounds.
Bake for 20 minutes until the pastry has risen considerably and the insides are dry.
Transfer the chilled pastry cream into a piping bag with a small tip.
Poke a hole in the center of the bottom of each cream puff and fill each puff with the pastry cream.
Microwave the chocolate at 30-second intervals until smooth.
Mix in coconut oil if using.
Dip the top of each filled cream puff into the chocolate, dripping off any excess.
Enjoy!
