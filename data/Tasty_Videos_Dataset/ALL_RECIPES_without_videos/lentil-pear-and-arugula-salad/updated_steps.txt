Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).
In small bowl, add the coconut flakes, soy sauce, maple syrup, and liquid smoke.
Mix until well-combined.
Spread evenly on a greased baking sheet, making sure the flakes aren’t touching as much as possible.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes, until golden brown.
Then remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the arugula, pears, lentils, and coconut bacon.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, add the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper.
Mix until well-combined.
Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss well.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
