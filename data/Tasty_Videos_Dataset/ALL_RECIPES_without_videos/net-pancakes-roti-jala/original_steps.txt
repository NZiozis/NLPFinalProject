In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, water, coconut milk, eggs, salt, and turmeric until smooth. (If any clumps remain, run mixture through a sieve.)
Using a sharp-pointed knife (a corkscrew or nail works just as well), poke three holes in the cap of a plastic water bottle.
Fill the bottle with your pancake batter.
Heat a very lightly greased nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working quickly, invert the water bottle and drizzle the batter in quick circular motions forming a netlike pattern.
Allow the pancake to cook for one to two minutes. Do not flip and watch closely so it doesnâ€™t burn.
Remove from pan, fold in the sides, and roll up. Serve with curry.
Enjoy!
