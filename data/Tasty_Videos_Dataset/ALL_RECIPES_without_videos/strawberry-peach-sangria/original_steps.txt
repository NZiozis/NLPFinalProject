Discard the green tops of the strawberries and slice the peaches.
In a saucepan, dissolve sugar in water.
Add the strawberries and peaches.
Bring to a rolling boil and reduce to medium heat. Boil for approximately 15 minutes, or until the strawberries become pale and the peaches are soft.
Strain the syrup and refrigerate for 2 hours, or until cooled. Discard boiled fruit.
In a pitcher, combine the cooled syrup, sliced extra fruit, white wine, and rum.
Chill for 2-4 hours.
Scoop fruit into glasses with ice, pour sangria, and top with champagne or sparkling wine.
Enjoy!
