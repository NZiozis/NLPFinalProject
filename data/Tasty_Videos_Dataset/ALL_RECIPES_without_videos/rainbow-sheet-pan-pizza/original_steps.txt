In a small bowl, combine half of the warm water and the brown sugar.
Add the active dry yeast and let foam without stirring for about 8 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the pureed beets, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, 2 cups (250 g) of flour, and the yeast mixture.
Rinse the yeast mixture bowl with the remaining warm water to get all the yeast, and pour into the large bowl.
Mix with your hands and gradually add in the reamining flour until the dough comes together in a ball and is not moist to the touch.
Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and bouncy and does not stick to the surface. Add flour as needed.
Pour the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a clean large bowl and rub around with your fingers.
Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with the oil.
Cover with a kitchen towel or a plastic wrap and let rise for at least 1 hour at room temperature (preferably warm). The dough should double in size.
Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C).
Grease a nonstick baking sheet with the olive oil.
Place the dough on a floured surface and divide in half.
Save one dough half for later. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks in a bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap.
Using a rolling pin, flatten the remaining ball of dough into a rectangular shape that will approximately fit on the baking sheet.
Transfer the dough to baking sheet and stretch as needed to cover the pan.
Leaving a 1-inch (2 cm) border all around the sides, spread the pizza sauce over the dough and sprinkle with mozzarella.
Add strips of cherry tomatoes, orange bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, spinach, and roasted purple sweet potatoes.
Season with salt, pepper, and oregano.
Bake for 7-10 minutes, until the veggies are tender and the crust is cooked.
Sprinkle with fresh basil, then slice and serve.
Enjoy!
