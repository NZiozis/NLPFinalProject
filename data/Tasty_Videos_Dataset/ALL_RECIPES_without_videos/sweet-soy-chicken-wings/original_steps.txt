Preheat oil to about 160˚C (320˚F).
Season both sides of the chicken wings with salt and pepper. Coat with potato starch.
Fry the wings at 160˚C (320˚F) approximately 7 minutes.
Heat oil to about 180˚C (350˚F). Fry the wings until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain them on paper towels. Set aside.
Make the glaze. Combine all the glaze ingredients in a shallow pan and bring it to a simmer. Reduce until thick. Toss in the wings.
Sprinkle toasted white sesame.
Enjoy!
