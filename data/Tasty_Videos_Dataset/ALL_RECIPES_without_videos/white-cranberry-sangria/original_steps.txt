In a large pitcher, combine the orange, lime, cranberries, simple syrup, vodka, orange liqueur, white cranberry juice, and white wine. Stir well, then chill until ready to serve, up to 2 days.
Immediately before serving, add the lemon-lime soda and stir to incorporate.
Pour into glasses and garnish with orange wedges.
Enjoy!
