Carefully slice 3 gold potatoes into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices using a knife or mandoline.
In a large bowl, coat chips with vinegar so all are submerged, allow to sit for 30 minutes (the longer they sit the more vinegary they will taste).
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC).
Drain the chips and then mix in salt and pepper.
Arrange chips on greased baking sheet.
Bake for 30-35 minutes.
Enjoy!
