Cook fusilli ( or rotini) in boiling salted water until itâ€™s al dente.
Reserve 1 cup (235 ml) of the pasta water before draining.
Add basil, garlic, pine nuts, salt, and pepper to a food processor or blender and pulse to start to break up the ingredients.
Add water and a splash of the olive oil to get things started.
Scrape down the sides of processor bowl to ensure everything is being incorporated evenly.
Put the top back on, turn on the food processor, and slowly drizzle the remaining olive oil through the hole on the top of the food processor until emulsified in the sauce.
Pour the pesto into a bowl, then stir in the parmesan.
(The heat of the food processor will start to melt the cheese, so adding it afterwards retains a nice texture)
Drain the pasta and transfer to large bowl or pan.
Add pesto and a splash of pasta water, stirring to incorporate.
Add parmesan and another splash of pasta water.
Top off with more cheese and basil before serving.
Enjoy!
