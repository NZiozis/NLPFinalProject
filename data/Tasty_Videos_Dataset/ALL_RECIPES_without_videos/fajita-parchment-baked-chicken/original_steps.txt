Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Fold the parchment paper in half, then open up.
Thinly slice the peppers and onion and lay them on one half of the parchment paper.
Drizzle on oil and sprinkle on salt & pepper.
Lay the chicken on the peppers. Season with taco seasoning, salt and pepper, and spoon on salsa. Top with cheese.
Fold the parchment paper over the chicken, and cinch the paper together by folding it over itself along the edges.
Bake for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 165˚F (75˚C).
Enjoy!
