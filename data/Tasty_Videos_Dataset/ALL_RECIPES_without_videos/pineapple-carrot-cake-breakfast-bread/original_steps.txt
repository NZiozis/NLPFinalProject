Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Generously grease a 9 (22 cm) x 4 (10 cm) loaf pan with oil.
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and salt. Add the oats and whisk to combine.
In a separate large bowl, combine the shredded carrots, pineapple, eggs, and melted butter. Mix well.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until there are no dry clumps left. Gently fold in the walnuts, if using.
Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.
Bake for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
While the bread is baking, make the Greek yogurt “frosting”: In a small bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, maple syrup, and 2 tablespoons of the reserved pineapple juice. Stir until well incorporated. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes, until safe to handle. Remove from the loaf pan and let cool completely on a wire rack.
Slice the bread and serve with a smear of frosting.
Enjoy!
