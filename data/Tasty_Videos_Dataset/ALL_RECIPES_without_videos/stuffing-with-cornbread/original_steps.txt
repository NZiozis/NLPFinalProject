Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking dish.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until the fat has rendered, about 3 minutes.
Add the celery, onion, and garlic. Cook until softened and golden, about 5 minutes.
Add the thyme and rosemary. Cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, turkey stock, half of the parsley, the salt, and pepper.
In a large bowl, combine the bread and cooked bacon mixture.
Pour the egg mixture over the bread and vegetable mixture, and stir to coat.
Transfer the stuffing to the prepared baking dish and cover with foil.
Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
Top with the remaining parsley.
Enjoy!
