Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)
Cook bacon in a cast iron pan over medium heat. Once bacon fat coats the pan, add the Brussels sprouts, salt, pepper, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, garlic. Stir until fully coated.
Cook until the bottom of the Brussel sprouts begin to brown on the bottom.
Transfer the cast iron pan to the oven and roast for 20 minutes, or until tender, flipping the brussel sprouts over every 5 minutes or so.
Sprinkle Parmesan cheese evenly over the Brussels sprouts, then place the pan back in the oven and bake for other 3 to 5 minutes.
Sprinkle with additional bacon and chives then serve.
Enjoy!
