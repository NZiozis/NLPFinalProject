Remove from the skillet, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Wipe out the skillet, and add another tablespoon of oil to the pan.

Once the plantains are tender, scoop them out from the water and place in a separate large bowl, and keep the starchy boiling liquid warm on the stove.
Add the butter and about 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot starchy plantain liquid.
Mash the cooked plantains together until it is creamy and smooth.
Add more liquid as needed.
