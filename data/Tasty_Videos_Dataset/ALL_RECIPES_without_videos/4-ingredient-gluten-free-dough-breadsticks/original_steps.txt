Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt until a dough forms.
Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured surface and flatten into an 8-inch (20-cm) disk.
Cut the disk into 6 equal parts and roll each part into 8-inch (20-cm) logs.
Transfer the logs to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
In a small bowl, combine the oil and Italian seasoning. Use a pastry brush to brush the oil mixture over the breadsticks.
Bake for 15 minutes, until the breadsticks are set and just starting to brown.
Enjoy!
