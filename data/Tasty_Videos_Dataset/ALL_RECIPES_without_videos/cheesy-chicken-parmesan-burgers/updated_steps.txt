Stir bread crumbs, salt, and parmesan together in a bowl.
In a large bowl, mix together chicken, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, parsley, minced garlic, and parmesan cheese.
Grab a handful of the chicken mixture and pat it out flat in your palm.
Place a slice of mozzarella cheese in the middle and fold the chicken over the edges.
Make sure the cheese is fully covered on both sides by the chicken mixture.
Cover the patty with the bread crumb mixture on both sides.
Cook patty in a pan over medium-high heat for 4 minutes on each side.
Place on a bun and garnish with marinara sauce and fresh basil.
Enjoy!
