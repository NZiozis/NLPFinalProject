Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a skillet over medium heat, add cooking oil or water and mushrooms.
Cook down until mushrooms begin to brown, stirring occasionally.
Add the onion and cook until onions are translucent.
Add the garlic and stir until fragrant.
Transfer to a large bowl.
To the mushroom mixture, add breadcrumbs, oats, parsley, Parmesan, oregano, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and stir to combine.
Add eggs and mix well.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
When ready, use your hands to form 1-inch (2-cm) balls from the mushroom mixture.
Place in rows on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden, flipping halfway.
Enjoy!
