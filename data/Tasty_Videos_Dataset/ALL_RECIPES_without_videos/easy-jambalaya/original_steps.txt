Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add diced chicken breasts and Andouille sausage. Add salt and pepper to taste, and cook thoroughly.
Add crushed garlic and a diced jalapeño pepper.
NOTE: Leave the jalapeño seeds in for extra spice
Stir in diced onion, peppers, celery until they’re soft.
Add chicken stock, tomatoes, rice, cajun seasoning, bay leaf, dried thyme, cayenne pepper and stir.
Cover and simmer stew for 30 minutes.
NOTE: Stir occasionally to make sure the rice doesn’t burn at the bottom of the pan.
Once the rice is cooked, add in shrimp, season with salt and pepper, then continue simmering until the shrimp are cooked through.
Enjoy!
