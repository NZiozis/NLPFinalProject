Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a food processor add the broccoli, 1 cup of Parmesan, 1 clove of garlic, the egg, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
Pulse until mixture forms a dough like texture, about 2 minutes.
Place 1 tablespoon of the broccoli mixture and press into a well greased muffin tin.
Form the mixture into a cup, making the bottom and sides ½-inches (1 cm) thick.
Bake for about 30 minutes until the edges are golden and crispy and the bottom is firm.
Cool the broccoli cups.
Once cooled, remove from the muffin tin.
In a bowl add the ricotta, salt, 3 tablespoons basil, and parsley and stir to combine.
Fill the broccoli Parmesan cups with the ricotta mixture.
Top with slices of tomatoes and basil.
Broccoli Parmesan Cups can be stored up to 3 days and can be reheated in the oven.
Enjoy!
