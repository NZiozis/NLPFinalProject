In a large bowl, place the chicken soy sauce, honey, sesame seeds, and spring onion.
Stir well, refrigerate and marinade for at least 2 hours.
On soaked bamboo sticks, skewer on the chicken and mushrooms.
Repeat until the skewer is full.
On a coal BBQ, cook the chicken skewers for 3-4 minutes a side until the chicken is cooked through and the skewers are golden brown.
Enjoy!
