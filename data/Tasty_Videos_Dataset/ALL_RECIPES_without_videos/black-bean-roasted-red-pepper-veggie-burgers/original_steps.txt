Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a large bowl, microwave black beans for 1 minute, or until softened.
Add roasted red peppers, garlic, cayenne, cumin, and salt. Mash until black beans are finely mashed.
Add cornmeal and mix until thoroughly combined.
Using a ½ cup (120 ml) measuring cup, portion 5 patties from the mixture. Place onto a lightly greased parchment paper-lined sheet pan.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until firm and browned, flipping over halfway through.
Serve burgers with your favorite fixins.
Enjoy!
