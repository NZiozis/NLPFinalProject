Slice chicken breast into cubes.
In a bowl, combine marinade ingredients. Add chicken and stir to coat.
Let marinate at least 1 hour.
In a pan, heat oil on medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade with a slotted spoon, and cook all sides until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Add sauce ingredients to pan and bring to a boil, mixing continuously, until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.
Serve over rice if desired.
Enjoy!
