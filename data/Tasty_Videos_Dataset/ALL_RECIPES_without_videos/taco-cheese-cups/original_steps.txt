Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until edges of cheese piles are golden brown.
Cool for 1 minute.
Press cheese piles into mini muffin tin slots to form cups. Allow cheese to cool completely before removing.
Add ground beef and salt to a skillet over medium-high heat and cook until browned.
Drain grease from the meat.
Add garlic, cumin, chili powder, and water to skillet and stir until well-incorporated.
Stir in salt.
Distribute meat to cheese cups.
Garnish with tomatoes, guacamole, and Greek yogurt.
