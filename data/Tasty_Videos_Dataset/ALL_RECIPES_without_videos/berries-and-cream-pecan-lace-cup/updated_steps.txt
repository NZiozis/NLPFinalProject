Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the butter brown sugar and corn syrup to a boil.
Remove from heat.
Add the flour and nuts into the butter mixture.
Stir until cooled, about 10 minutes.
On a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, use a teaspoon to scoop 5 balls 5 inches (13 cm) apart onto the baking sheet.
Bake for 6-7 minutes, until the edges are a deep golden color.
Let the cookies cool for about 1 minute, until they are cool enough to handle but still flexible.
Place the cookie over the backside of a muffin tin and gently form until the cookie is a cup shape.
Wait until the cookie has hardened into the cup shape, then remove from the muffin tin, about 1 minute.
In a bowl, microwave the chocolate in 20-second intervals, stirring in between for 1 minute.
Take one of the pecan lace cookie cups and dip the edge into the chocolate.
Let cool.
Place one dollop of whipped cream in the cookie cup and top with 2 strawberry halves and 3 raspberries.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
