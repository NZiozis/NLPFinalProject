Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Add the onion, garlic, and chili powder and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Add the tomatoes, black beans, water, salt, and pepper and let simmer for about 20 minutes.
Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until slightly chunky, or transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree, then transfer back to the pot.
Ladle half of the soup into a bowl and garnish with red onion, cilantro, and a lime wedge.
Store the remaining soup in the fridge.
Enjoy!
