Fill a food processor with heavy cream, condensed milk, and bananas.
Close the top and blend for 30 seconds.
Use a funnel or carefully pour the ice cream mixture into a large squeeze bottle and tighten the lid.
Layout a large thick cloth on top of your cooking area to protect the surface from the liquid nitrogenâ€™s low temperature.
Using insulated gloves, fill a stainless steel bowl with liquid nitrogen and set it on top of the thick insulated cloth.
Use the squeeze bottle to squeeze the mix at a constant drip into the liquid nitrogen.
Fill the bowl with droplets and allow the liquid nitrogen to boil off.
Once all the liquid has boiled over from the bottom, serve.
Enjoy!
