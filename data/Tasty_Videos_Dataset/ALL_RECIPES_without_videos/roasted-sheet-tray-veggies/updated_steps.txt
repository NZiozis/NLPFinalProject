Preheat the oven to 400°F (200˚C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Toss the cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and olive oil together on the baking sheet until everything is well-coated.
Season with salt, pepper, and garlic and toss to distribute.
Bake until the vegetables are tender and starting to brown, about 20 minutes.
Once cooled, transfer to an airtight container and store in the fridge.
Enjoy!
