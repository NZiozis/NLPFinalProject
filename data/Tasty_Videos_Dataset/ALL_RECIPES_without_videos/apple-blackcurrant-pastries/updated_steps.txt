Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Roll out the sheet of puff pastry and cut into 8 equal rectangles.
Cut a border about 1 cm (½ inch) from the outside, not cutting all the way through the pastry.
Spread the blackcurrant jam all over the center.
Layer apples in an overlapping pattern.
Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
Transfer to parchment-lined tray and brush with egg wash.
Bake for 25 minutes, then cool.
Mix together the icing sugar and milk until it is a thick paste.
Drizzle over the cooled pastries.
Enjoy!
