Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Gut 6-8 small pumpkins, and place on a baking sheet.
Combine all crust ingredients in a medium sized bowl.
It should be the consistency of peanut butter, or more runny.
Spread over the inside of the mini pumpkin - the moisture will aid in softening the pumpkin while cooking.
Combine all filling ingredients in a large bowl.
Mix until smooth.
Use a plastic bag to squeeze into the pumpkins.
Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the pumpkins begin to pucker, and the tops darken.
Combine coconut cream and powdered sugar, and beat or whip for three minutes.
(for fluffier whipped cream, use thicker coconut cream, and chill for 1 hour).
Drizzle cream over top of hot pumpkin.
Enjoy!
