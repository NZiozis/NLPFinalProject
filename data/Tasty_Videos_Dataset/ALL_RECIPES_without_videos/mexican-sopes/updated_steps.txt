In a medium bowl, mix the masa flour and ½ cup (120 ml) of water together with your hands.
Once combined, add the rest of the water and knead until the dough forms a smooth ball.
Heat a large pan or griddle over medium-high heat.
Pat the dough out into 6 flat circles.
Fry the dough, turning frequently, until just lightly brown about 5 minutes.
Once the dough is cooked, shape the sopes by pinching the sides up to form a wall around the edge.
Set aside to cool.
Rip the stems off the dried chiles and discard the seeds.
Rinse the chiles, if necessary.
Add the chiles to a small pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat.
Once boiling, remove the pot from the heat.
Transfer the chiles and their cooking liquid to a blender and add 1 teaspoon of salt and the garlic.
Blend until smooth.
Set aside.
Add the tomatoes to a small pot of water and bring to a boil.
Cook until the tomato skins split, then remove from the heat and drain, reserving ½ cup (120 ml) of the tomato water.
Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with the reserved cooking liquid, oregano, and ½ teaspoon of salt.
Blend until smooth.
Set aside.
Heat a large pan or griddle over medium-high heat.
Add the skirt steak and season with the meat seasoning and remaining teaspoon of salt.
Cook the meat, flipping frequently until seared and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Transfer the meat to a cutting board and cut into small pieces.
Set aside.
Heat the corn oil in a deep, large pan over high heat.
Dip the sopes in the chile sauce, turning to coat completely.
Once the oil is hot, fry the sopes, flipping frequently, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Drain the sopes on paper towels or a wire rack.
To serve, fill the sopes with refried beans, carne asada, shredded lettuce, tomato sauce, Mexican crema, and queso fresco.
Enjoy!
