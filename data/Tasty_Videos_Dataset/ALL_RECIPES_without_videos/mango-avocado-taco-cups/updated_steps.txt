Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC).
Generously coat a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
Stack the tortillas and cut off the edges so the tortillas are square.
Then, quarter the squares so you have 12 small tortilla pieces.
Press a tortilla square into each cup of the prepared muffin tin.
Bake for about 10 minutes, until the edges of the tortillas are golden brown.
Let cool for 5 minutes.
Fill each cup with 1 tablespoon of avocado and 1 tablespoon of mango and top with 1 teaspoon of salsa verde.
Garnish with cilantro
Enjoy!
