Preheat oven to 350˚F (175˚C)
Cut biscuits in half and cube the cream cheese (32 pieces).
Flatten each biscuit and place one cube of cream cheese and a few chocolate chips in the center of each.
Fold the biscuit dough around the cream cheese and chocolate and form into a ball.
In a large plastic bag combine white sugar and cinnamon.
Add 6-8 dough balls to the bag, seal the bag, and shake until well coated.
Repeat for the remainder of the stuffed dough pieces.
In a microwave safe bowl add brown sugar and butter.
Microwave on high for 70 seconds - stopping halfway to stir.
Remove from microwave and stir until it reaches a caramel consistency.
In a greased bundt pan, sprinkle half of the walnuts, half the dough pieces, and drizzle half the caramel glaze.
Repeat with remaining walnuts, dough, and glaze.
Bake for 30-35 minutes.
Remove from oven and turn upside down onto a plate to cool for 10 minutes before lifting off the pan (this way the warm glaze runs back through and fully coats all the bread)
Enjoy!
