Preheat the oven at 180°C (350˚F).
Prepare the toffee by gently heating the brown sugar and butter together over a low heat in a saucepan.
Once bubbling, stir in the apple slices for a few minutes and take off the heat just as they start to soften.
Lay out half of the apple slices in a oven-proof dish and then throw the bread chunks on top.
Lay the rest of the apple slices on top and set the remaining toffee mixture aside.
In a jug, mix together the cream, milk, and eggs.
Pour all over the apple slices and bread.
Bake for 1 hour.
Reheat the toffee mixture and then pour over the bread pudding.
Serve with vanilla ice cream.
Enjoy!
