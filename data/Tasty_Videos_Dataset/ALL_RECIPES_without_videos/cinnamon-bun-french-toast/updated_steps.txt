Whisk eggs, cinnamon, vanilla and milk together in medium-large bowl to create egg wash.
In medium bowl mix cream cheese, heavy cream, powdered sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.
Dunk 2 slices of bread in egg wash.
Melt butter in a skillet on medium-low heat and cook bread for 2-3 minutes or until crumbs are crispy and bread is more solid, adding some additional butter to each toasted side.
Add additional cinnamon to taste.
Stack and drizzle with cream cheese mixture.
Enjoy!
