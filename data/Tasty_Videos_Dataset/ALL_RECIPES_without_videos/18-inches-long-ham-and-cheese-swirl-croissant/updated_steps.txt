Lightly flour a clean work surface.
Flour a rolling pin and roll out each puff pastry sheet to flatten the seams.
Lay the sheets 2 by 2.
Make a diagonal cut across the 2 bottom sheets of puff pastry from the lower right corner to the midpoint on the left side of the lower left sheet.
Make another diagonal cut across the 2 top sheets of puff pastry from the upper right corner to the midpoint on the left side of the upper left sheet.
Holding the bottom pieces together, rotate clockwise 180˚ and up, so that the left side of the bottom strip meets the left side of the lower middle strip.
Holding the top pieces together, rotate counterclockwise 180˚ and down, so that the left side of the top strip meets the left side of the up middle strip.
Seal the seams by brushing a bit of egg wash where the pieces of pastry meet, overlapping the pieces slightly, and pressing together.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Arrange the cheese slices in a single layer across the lower portion of the triangle.
Top with a single layer of ham slices.
Roll up the puff pastry from the base of the triangle to the top point.
Place the croissant on the prepared baking sheet and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake for 45 minutes
Remove the croissant from the oven, take off the foil, and brush the croissant with egg wash.
Bake for another 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the croissant is golden brown.
Let cool for 20 minutes, then slice and serve.
Enjoy!
