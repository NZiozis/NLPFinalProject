In a large bowl, combine 1 cup rice wine (235 ml), ¼ cup (60 ml) of soy sauce, and cubed chicken thighs.
Stir and cover with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to an hour.
In a separate large bowl, combine 1 cup of flour (140 g) and 1 tablespoon of salt.
Remove chicken from wine/soy marinade and place in flour mixture.
Mix thoroughly, until all the chicken pieces are coated.
Fill a dutch oven or large pot at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep with vegetable oil.
Heat oil to 365˚F (185˚C).
Place chicken pieces in frying oil, stirring occasionally.
Fry until they are golden brown, roughly 4-5 minutes.
Remove chicken from oil and set aside to drain on paper towels or a wire rack.
In a large skillet, bring one tablespoon of vegetable oil to medium-high heat.
Add garlic and ginger, stirring frequently for one minute.
Add dried chili pods.
Continue stirring for 30 seconds before adding rice wine, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sugar.
Stir occasionally until mixture is bubbling.
Add cornstarch slurry, stirring frequently.
The sauce should begin to thicken in a minute or less.
Add cooked chicken pieces, stirring them to coat with the sauce.
Remove from heat and garnish with green onions and rice.
Enjoy!
