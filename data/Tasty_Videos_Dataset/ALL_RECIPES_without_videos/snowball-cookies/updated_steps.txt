Preheat oven to 325˚F (170˚C).
Place the walnuts in a ziploc bag and use a rolling pin to crush them until crushed.
In a large bowl, combine crushed walnuts, flour, sugar, softened butter, vanilla and mix with a rubber spatula until well combined.
Roll the dough into ping pong ball-sized spheres.
Bake for 20-30 minutes, until the bottom of the cookies is slightly brown.
While the cookies are still warm, sift powdered sugar over the cookies.
Enjoy!
