In a food processor, pulse the broccoli florets and stems until they reach your desired “rice” consistency.
In pan over medium heat, add oil and garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.
Add riced broccoli, salt, and pepper, and cook 5 minutes, or until tender.
Add Parmesan and stir to combine.
Serve with a sprinkle of Parmesan.
Enjoy!
