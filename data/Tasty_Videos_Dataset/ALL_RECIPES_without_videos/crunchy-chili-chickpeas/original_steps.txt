Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Drain, rinse, and dry the chickpeas. Spread on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake the chickpeas for 40-45 minutes, until golden and slightly dry. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a medium bowl. Keep the oven on.
Add the olive oil, chili powder, garlic powder, and salt. Toss until the chickpeas are well coated.
Return the chickpeas to the baking sheet and bake for another 10-15 minutes, until golden brown and crunchy.
Enjoy!
