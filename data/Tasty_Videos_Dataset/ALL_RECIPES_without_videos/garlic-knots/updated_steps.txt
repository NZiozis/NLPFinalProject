For the dough, mix together the flour, yeast, and salt, and make a well in the middle.
Pour the water and 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the well and mix together.
Knead for about 7-10 minutes until the dough is springy.
Line a bowl with the other teaspoon of olive oil, place the dough in the bowl, cover, and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour (or until doubled in size).
Tear the dough into 9 separate balls and then roll into long tubes, folding over to make a knot.
Place the knots on a baking tray.
Bake in a 350°F (180°C) oven for 10 minutes.
Prepare the garlic butter by mixing the butter, garlic, and parsley.
Coat the knots with the butter mixture and bake for another 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
