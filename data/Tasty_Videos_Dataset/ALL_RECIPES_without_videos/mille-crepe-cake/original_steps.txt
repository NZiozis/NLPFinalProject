Make the crepes by melting the butter and allowing it to brown slightly. Set aside.
In the same pot, warm the milk. Remove from heat.
In a bowl, whisk flour, cocoa powder, and sugar. Mix in eggs.
Gradually mix in butter and warm milk. Chill.
On a nonstick skillet over medium heat, pour Â¼ cup (60 ml) of crepe batter, and tip the pan to cover the entire bottom surface. Cook until bottom surface of crepe begins to brown, then flip.
Cool crepe. Repeat until all of the crepe batter is used.
Stack crepes on top of each other, with whipped cream between each layer. Once assembled, trim edges for a cleaner look, if desired.
For the ganache, bring the heavy cream and sugar to a boil, and pour over chocolate and butter. Let cool.
Spread over the crepe cake.
Top with sifted powdered sugar (optional).
Enjoy!
