Chop kimchi and place in bowl, set aside.
In a medium saucepan, melt cheddar cheese part way (until itâ€™s mostly soft but still clumpy).
Add the sour cream.
Melt and stir until the mixture is smooth.
Add the red pepper powder and stir until evenly integrated.
Add kimchi and simmer until evenly mixed and smooth.
The liquid from the kimchi may give the appearance that the queso is chunky, continue heating and stirring 5-10 minutes and it will smooth out.
Serve garnished with chopped green onion.
Goes great with chips, raw vegetables, or straight into the mouth via spoon.
Enjoy!
