Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a bowl, mash the bananas with a fork.
Add in the melted butter, egg, sugar, and vanilla and mix until combined.
Add in the flour, baking soda, and salt and mix again until just combined.
Pour the batter into a loaf pan.
Bake for 50 minutes, or until cooked through.
Once cool, take the banana bread out of the pan and slice into three horizontal layers, widthwise.
Line the loaf pan with plastic wrap and place the bottom layer of bread in the pan.
Top the bread with the softened vanilla ice cream and spread evenly with a spoon.
Place the middle layer of bread on top of the vanilla ice cream.
Top the middle layer with chocolate ice cream and spread evenly with a spoon.
Place the top of the banana bread on top and cover with the plastic wrap.
Freeze for one hour or or overnight.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
