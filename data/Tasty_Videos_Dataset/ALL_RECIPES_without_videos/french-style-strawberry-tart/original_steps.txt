Pre-heat the oven to 190°C (375°F).
Roll out the puff pastry sheet. Place a 25-centimetre (9-inch) cake tin on the sheet of puff pastry and cut around the edges.
Poke holes in the pastry with a fork and set aside.
Prepare the strawberries by hulling them with a straw. Set aside.
Pour the sugar in a large saucepan and cook over a medium heat, until the sugar has melted and reached a light brown colour.
Stir in the butter until melted.
Add the strawberries, coating evenly in the caramel.
Arrange the strawberries in the buttered tin, followed by the puff pastry on top.
Tuck the pastry down the sides of the tin.
Bake for 45 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.
Leave to cool for 1-2 hours, then invert onto a plate.
Slice and serve with a spoonful of crème fraîche.
Enjoy!
