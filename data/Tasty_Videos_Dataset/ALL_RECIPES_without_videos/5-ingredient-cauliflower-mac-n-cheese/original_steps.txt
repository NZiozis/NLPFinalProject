Cut cauliflower into small florets, about 4 cups (1.2 kg).
Add cauliflower florets into a 6-quart (6 L) Dutch oven of boiling water and boil for 5 minutes.
Drain the cauliflower in a colander, and return to the pot. Reduce heat to low.
Add in salt, pepper, and sour cream, and stir until thoroughly combined.
Stir in cheddar cheese until melted.
Remove from heat. Top with parsley (optional).
Enjoy!
