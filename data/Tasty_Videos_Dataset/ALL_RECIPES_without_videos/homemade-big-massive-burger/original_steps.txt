Roll half of the beef mince into a ball and pat it down until a finger thick, bigger than palm size patty. Repeat with remaining beef.
Fry both patties with salt and pepper for 2 and a half minutes a side. Add 1 cheese single to one of the patties.
Toast the burger buns on a dry pan on medium heat until one of the sides is golden brown.
Mix all the sauce ingredients and set aside.
Time to build this bad boy! Spread burger sauce on a bun, sprinkle diced onion, shredded lettuce, place the patty with cheese, place another slice of bun.
Then more sauce, more onion, shredded lettuce, gherkin slices, another patty, and the last slice of bun!
Dig in and get lovinâ€™ it!
Enjoy!
