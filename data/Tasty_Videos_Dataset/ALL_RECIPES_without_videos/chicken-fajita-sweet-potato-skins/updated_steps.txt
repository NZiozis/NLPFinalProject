Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Using a fork, poke holes down one side of each sweet potato.
Microwave for 3-5 minutes, or until softened.
Let sweet potatoes cool before handling.
Cut the sweet potatoes in half and carve out the centers, leaving a small rim around the outside of each “boat.”
Place sweet potato boats on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.
Add the bell peppers and onion to the other side of the baking sheet.
Mix the fajita seasoning ingredients together.
Drizzle in olive oil.
Season the boats and veggies.
Add chicken breast on top of the veggies, drizzle in olive oil and add additional seasoning.
Bake 20-25 minutes, or until chicken reaches 165˚F (75˚C).
Let cool for a few minutes.
Shred the chicken with 2 forks and mix together with the veggies.
Fill up sweet potato boats and top with mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 5 more minutes, or until cheese is melted.
Garnish with your favorite toppings (we used guacamole and cilantro).
Enjoy!
