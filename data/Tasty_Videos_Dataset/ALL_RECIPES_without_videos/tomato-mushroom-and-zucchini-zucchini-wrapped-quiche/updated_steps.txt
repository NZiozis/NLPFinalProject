Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
Trim the ends from the zucchini, then slice lengthwise with a vegetable peeler.
Line the muffin cups with the zucchini strips.
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, tomato, diced zucchini, mushroom, milk, salt, and pepper.
Add a bit of crumbled feta to each zucchini cup.
Divide the egg mixture evenly among the cups.
Bake for 18 minutes, until the edges are slightly browned.
Enjoy!
