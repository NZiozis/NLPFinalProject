Using a serrated knife, cut the pint of ice cream crosswise into 3 equal discs.
Lay out 3 sugar cookies and place a pint slice on top of each.
Place another sugar cookie on top of each sandwich.
Remove the ice cream packaging.
Freeze for 30 minutes.
In a small bowl, stir together the graham crackers and freeze-dried strawberries until thoroughly mixed.
In a liquid measuring cup or deep, microwave-safe bowl, combine white chocolate chips and coconut oil.
Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until the white chocolate is silky smooth.
Let the white chocolate cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes.
Remove the ice cream sandwiches from the freezer and dip half of each sandwich into the white chocolate, then roll the dipped side in the graham cracker and strawberry mixture until fully covered.
Freeze for 30 minutes more before serving.
Enjoy!
