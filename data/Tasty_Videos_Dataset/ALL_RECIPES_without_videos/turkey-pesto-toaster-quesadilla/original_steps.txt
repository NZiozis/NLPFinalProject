Spread the pesto evenly over the tortilla with a butter knife.
Peel the mozzarella string cheese into strips. Place the cheese and roasted red peppers over the top half of the tortilla. Top with the turkey.
Fold the tortilla in half from the bottom, then fold in the sides, being careful not to tear the tortilla.
Toast on medium-high, until golden brown. Watch to make sure it doesnâ€™t burn. Let cool for 1-2 minutes before removing from the toaster.
Enjoy!
