Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Butter each side of the tortillas and cut into even quarters, making 24 pieces.
Place one piece in each cup of a muffin tin and push down so it creates a cup shape.
(Make 2 batches or use 2 muffin tins to make the full amount of cups).
Bake for 10-12 minutes or until crisp.
In a bowl, mix together shrimp, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, chili powder, cayenne, garlic, and lime juice.
Cook over medium high heat for 8 minutes, flipping halfway.
Set aside.
In another bowl, combine diced avocado, tomato, red onion, jalapeno, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and pepper.
Stir gently.
Assemble the cups by placing a spoonful of the avocado salsa in the toasted cup.
Place a piece of shrimp on top, followed by a dollop of sour cream.
Serve with lime wedges.
Enjoy!
