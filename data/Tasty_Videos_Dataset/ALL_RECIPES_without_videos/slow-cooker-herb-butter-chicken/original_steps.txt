Slice the red potatoes in half.
Lay the potatoes and half of the onion in the bottom of the slow cooker.
Cut onion in half and save for later.
In a bowl, mix butter, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, and garlic until well-combined.
Stuff the chicken with the other half of the onion and lemon wedge.
Rub the herb butter mixture all over the outside of the chicken.
Place the chicken on top of the potatoes and onions in the slow cooker and place a sprig of thyme and rosemary on top. Cover and cook for 4 hours on high.
Remove the chicken from the slow cooker and place on a baking sheet. Remove the lemon and onion from inside the chicken.
Add the green beans to the slow cooker. Cover and cook for 20 minutes. Broil for 2-3 minutes or until the skin is golden brown. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before carving.
Enjoy!
