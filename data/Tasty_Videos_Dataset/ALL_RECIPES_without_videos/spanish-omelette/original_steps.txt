Heat up the olive oil in a really hot pan.
Thinly slice the onion.
Slice the potatoes into 3-millimeters thick pieces.
Fry the vegetables in the olive oil over high heat for 10-15 minutes until they caramelize.
Drain the vegetables and save the olive oil for later use.
Add 6 eggs to a bowl and whisk. Add the fried vegetables, stir, and leave to set for 15-20 minutes.
In a nonstick pan, fry the egg mixture over high heat for 1 minute, then reduce to a low heat for 2-4 minutes.
Cover the pan with a large plate and carefully turn the omelet out onto the plate.
Slide the omelet back into the pan and fry for a further 3-5 minutes over low heat. To check the omelet is cooked, gently press on the centre of the omelet. If the surface springs back, it is ready.
Repeat step 8 to remove omelet from the pan.
Enjoy!
