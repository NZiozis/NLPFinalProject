In a large saucepan, gently melt the sugar over a low-medium heat, swirling the pan consistently until it reaches a golden amber colour.
Stir in the butter until melted.
Stir in the double cream and allow to boil for 1 minute.
Stir in the sea salt and then remove from the heat.
Allow to cool before pouring in a clean, sterilized jar.
Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
Enjoy!
