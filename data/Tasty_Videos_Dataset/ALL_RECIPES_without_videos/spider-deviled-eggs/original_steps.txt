Use a spoon and carefully create cracks on 8 hard-boiled eggs.
Place the cracked eggs in a large bag. Add black food coloring and water.
Close the bag, mix around and set aside for 15 minutes.
Rinse the eggs in clean water and peel to reveal the cracked design.
Cut the eggs in half and separate the egg yolks from the egg whites.
Combine the egg yolks with mayonnaise, mustard and green food coloring.
Pipe the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites.
Garnish the deviled eggs with an olive spider. To create an olive spider use half of a black olive for the body and olive slices for the legs.
Enjoy!
