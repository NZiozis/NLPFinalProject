In a heavy bottom pot, combine the olive oil, onion, celery, and carrots over medium heat. Cook until the carrots soften and the onions become slightly translucent.
Add the garlic and salt, and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
Add the green beans, sauce, and water, and bring to a boil.
Add the beans and macaroni and cook for about 9-10 minutes until the macaroni is al dente.
Serve warm with Parmesan and basil.
Enjoy!
