Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease with nonstick spray.
Add the beaten eggs to the pan, cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the eggs are set, about 5 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat.
Transfer the cooked egg disc to a cutting board and cut into Â½-inch (1 cm) wide strips.
Toss with any sauce or in soup for easy egg noodles.
Enjoy!
