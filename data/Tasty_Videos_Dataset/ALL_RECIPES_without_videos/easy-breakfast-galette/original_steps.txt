Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)
Cut a large circle in the puff pastry sheet.
Sprinkle on cheese, and lay on the bacon.
Fold the edges of the puff pastry over themselves to make a rim—it doesn’t have to be perfect!
Bake for 10 minutes.
Remove from oven, and lay the tomatoes around the edge.
Crack eggs into the middle.
Bake for 15-20 additional minutes, depending on how runny you like your egg.
Remove from oven, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and chopped basil.
Slice into pieces, however big you like!
Enjoy!
