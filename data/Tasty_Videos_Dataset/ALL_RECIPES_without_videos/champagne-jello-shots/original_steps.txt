Boil two cups of water.
Mix 4 packets of unflavored gelatin into the water. Let cool for a few minutes.
Add one bottle of cream or vanilla soda, and Â¾ of a bottle of champagne.
Cover and refrigerate 3-5 hours. (Over night for a definite set)
If set in a pan, use a knife sprayed with cooking oil to cut. Or to make life easier, refrigerate in separate plastic cups.
Top with sprinkles and/or pop rocks, directly before serving! The pop rocks/ sprinkles will melt, so be sure to consume quickly!
Enjoy!
