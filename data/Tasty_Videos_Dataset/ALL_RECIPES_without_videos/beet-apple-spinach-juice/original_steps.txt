Add the celery, apple, beets, and spinach to a blender, and blend until smooth.
Using a mesh strainer, strain the juice over a large liquid measuring cup to remove the pulp. Use a spoon to help stir the pulp and press out the liquid. Reserve the pulp to make pulp muffins.
Chill the juice for at least 30 minutes (and keep up to 3 days).
Enjoy!
