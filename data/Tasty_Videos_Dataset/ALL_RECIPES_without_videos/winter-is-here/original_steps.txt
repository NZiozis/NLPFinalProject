Place a pint glass or stein in the freezer to chill while you make the milkshake.
In a blender, combine the ice cream and beer. Blend on medium speed until fully combined.
Drizzle the chocolate syrup around the inside of the chilled glass. Pour in the ice creamâ€“beer blend to fill.
Top with whipped cream and drizzle with more chocolate syrup.
Garnish with chocolate shavings.
Enjoy!
