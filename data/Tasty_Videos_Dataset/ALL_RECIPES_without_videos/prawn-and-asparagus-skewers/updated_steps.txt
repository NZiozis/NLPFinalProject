Add the lemon juice, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper into the melted butter and mix well.
On soaked bamboo sticks, skewer on the prawns and asparagus.
Repeat until the skewer is full.
Brush the butter mix onto to skewer.
On a coal BBQ, cook the steak skewers for 1-2 minutes a side, until the prawns turn pink and are cooked through.
Enjoy!
