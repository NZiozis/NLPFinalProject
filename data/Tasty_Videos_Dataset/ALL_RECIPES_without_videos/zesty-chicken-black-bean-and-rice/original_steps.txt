Season both sides of the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.
In a large skillet, add the olive oil and place the chicken skin side down for about 5 minutes or until skin is golden brown. Flip the chicken and cook for another 3 minutes.
Take the chicken out and add the onions and cook until theyâ€™re translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add the rice, stir to coat in the oil and onions, and toast for 3 minutes.
Add the garlic then pour in the chicken stock and place the chicken on top of the rice. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until rice is cooked.
Once cooked, take the chicken out and add in the cilantro, black beans, and the juice of one lime. Mix until well-incorporated.
Serve the chicken over rice and garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
