Heat the oil in a mini frying pan over low heat.
Place the pizza dough in the pan and let brown, 3-5 minutes.
Flip the dough and use a spatula to press the dough against the bottom of the pan and up the sides.
Spread marinara sauce in the center of the dough and top with mozzarella cheese and pepperoni.
Cook for 10 minutes, until the dough is crispy and cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
