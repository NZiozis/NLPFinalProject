Whisk together all the rub ingredients in a small bowl.
Spread the rub evenly over the pork ribs and place on a wire rack set over a baking sheet with meat side up. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
For the BBQ sauce, heat oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add poblano chile, red onion, garlic, ginger, and a pinch of salt, then cook until onions begin to soften.
Add the remaining sauce ingredients and bring the mixture to a simmer.
Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook at an active simmer until the mixture is reduced to about 2 cups (470 ml), about 30-45 minutes.
Once reduced, cool slightly then transfer mixture to a blender. Puree until smooth.
Preheat oven to 275˚F (140˚C).
Uncover the ribs. Spread 1 cup (290g) of the BBQ sauce over each rack of ribs.
Keeping them raised over the baking sheet on the wire rack. Pour water into the bottom of the baking sheet.
Bake in a preheated oven for 3-3 ½ hours.
Remove ribs from oven and preheat the broiler to high.
Broil the ribs for 5-10 minutes to finish, until the sauce caramelizes.
Cut into individual ribs.
Enjoy!
