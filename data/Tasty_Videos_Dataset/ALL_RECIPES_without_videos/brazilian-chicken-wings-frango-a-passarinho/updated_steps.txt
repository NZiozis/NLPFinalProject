Combine the chicken with the garlic, salt, pepper, and lime juice in a bowl until evenly coated.
Cover with cling film and refrigerate for about an hour.
Dip each chicken wing in the flour, shaking off excess.
Heat oil in a large pot to about 375°F.
Fry half of the chicken wings at a time until dark golden brown.
The oil temperature will drop to about 350°F.
Drain on paper towels.
Serve with lime wedges and fried garlic.
Enjoy!
