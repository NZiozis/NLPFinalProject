Place wax paper on a large baking sheet.
Slice bananas into Â½-inch (1 cm) thick rounds.
Spread peanut butter on a slice of banana, then top with another slice.
Lay the bites on the prepared baking sheet and freeze until solid, for about an hour.
In a small bowl, melt dark chocolate with coconut oil until smooth.
Remove frozen banana bites from the freezer. Dip the bites into the melted chocolate, place back on the wax paper.
Freeze for an additional hour.
