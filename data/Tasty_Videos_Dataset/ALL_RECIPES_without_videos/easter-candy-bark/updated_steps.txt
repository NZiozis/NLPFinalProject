Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place a large heatproof bowl over a medium pot of simmering water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the bottom of the bowl.
Add the chopped chocolate to the bowl and stir until fully melted, about 5 minutes.
Pour the melted chocolate mixture onto the baking sheet.
Use a spatula to smooth the chocolate into an even layer about ¼-inch (6 mm) thick.
Sprinkle the melted chocolate with your toppings of choice.
Sprinkle with sea salt.
Freeze until firm to the touch, at least 20 minutes.
Break the bark into pieces and serve.
Enjoy!
