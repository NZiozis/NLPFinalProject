Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
In a medium bowl combine granola ingredients, stir until well mixed.
Pour mixture onto a greased baking sheet.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, tossing halfway through to ensure even baking.
Save granola for up to 2 months, or use right away.
Assemble parfaits in bowls or mason jars (great for on the go!). Layer yogurt with granola and your choice of assorted mixed fruits and/or nuts, alternating layers.
Enjoy!
