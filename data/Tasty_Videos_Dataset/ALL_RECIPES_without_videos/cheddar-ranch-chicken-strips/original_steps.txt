Preheat oven to 425˚F (225˚C).
On a cutting board, slice chicken breasts against the grain into strips.
Place the chicken strips in a bowl and add in buttermilk and ranch packet. Stir until well-coated.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
Pour cheese crackers into a resealable bag and crush with a rolling pin until they become finely ground.
Open the bag and place a marinated piece of chicken in the cracker crumbs. Coat the chicken with the crumbs and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway.
Enjoy!
