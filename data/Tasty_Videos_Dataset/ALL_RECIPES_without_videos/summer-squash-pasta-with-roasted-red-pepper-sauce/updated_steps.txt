Heat oven to 500°F (260°C).
Spiralize the yellow squash and zucchinis into a large bowl.
Bring a large skillet over medium heat and add olive oil.
Sauté shallots and garlic until golden brown and soft, about 2-3 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper and stir.
Remove from heat and set aside.
Quarter and deseed the red bell peppers and arrange onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Roast the red peppers until black and charred bits appear, about 25-30 minutes.
Carefully remove the red peppers from the oven and remove the charred black bits.
Transfer the roasted peppers to a blender and add salt, pepper, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, sautéed shallot and garlic, and milk.
Blend on high speed until creamy.
Set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
Pour the pepper sauce in the skillet to thicken and simmer, about 2-3 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and continue simmering.
Add the spiralized veggies and stir to coat, cooking for 2-3 minutes.
Add basil and stir, 2-3 minutes.
Serve with red pepper flakes and basil.
Enjoy!
