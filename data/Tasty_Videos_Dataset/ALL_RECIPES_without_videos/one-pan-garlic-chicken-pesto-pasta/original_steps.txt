Heat the oil in a pan over high heat. Combine the chicken, garlic, salt, and pepper, cooking until chicken is browned.
Then, mix in the heavy cream, parmesan, and pesto, stirring until evenly combined.
Next, bring to a boil and cook until the sauce has reduced, about five to seven minutes.
Toss in the pasta and cherry tomatoes, stirring until evenly coated. Remove from heat.
To serve, sprinkle parmesan cheese and basil on top!
Enjoy!
