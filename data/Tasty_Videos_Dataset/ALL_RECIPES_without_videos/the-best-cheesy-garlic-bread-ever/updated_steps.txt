Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a bowl, combine the butter, herbs, garlic, and cheese, and mix until smooth.
Slice the baguette in half lengthwise, then spread the butter mixture evenly on the cut sides of the baguette.
Place the baguette a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and starting to brown on the edges.
Slice, cool, and serve!
Enjoy!
