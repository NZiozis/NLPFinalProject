Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
In a large bowl, whisk all the pancake ingredients together with a hand whisk until thoroughly combined.
Set aside.
Gently melt the butter in a cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat.
Pour the pancake mixture into the middle of the pan.
Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, until golden brown and risen.
Coat with icing sugar and maple syrup.
Enjoy!
