Preheat the Griddler, fitted with the waffle plates, to 375°F (190°C), and grease with nonstick spray.
Whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl until smooth.
Add the Greek yogurt and whisk again until smooth.
Whisk in the milk, oil, and maple syrup.
Add the flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and whisk together until the batter is smooth and well combined.
Use a 1-cup (130 G) measuring cup to pour batter onto the Griddler.
Cook for 10 minutes, until the waffle has puffed up and is golden brown. Transfer the waffle to a cutting board and repeat with the remaining batter.
Cut the waffles into sticks.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with maple syrup.
Enjoy!
