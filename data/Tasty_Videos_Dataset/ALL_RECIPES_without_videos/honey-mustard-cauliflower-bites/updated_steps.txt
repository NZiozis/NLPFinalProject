Preheat oven to 400˚F/200˚C.
Break the head of cauliflower into bite-sized florets.
In a large bowl, combine flour, garlic powder and almond milk.
Add the cauliflower florets and coat well.
Transfer the coated florets onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.
Remove the cauliflower from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes.
Once cool, transfer into a bowl, add honey mustard and coat well.
Return cauliflower to the baking sheet and bake for 10 more minutes or until heated through.
Serve with ranch or your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
