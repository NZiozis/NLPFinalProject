Preheat oven to 350˚F (175˚C)
Combine all seasoning ingredients and mix well. Add 2 tablespoons of the seasoning mixture to the Panko bread crumbs, set aside. (The extra seasoning can be used and stored for 1- 2 years!)
Coat the chicken in flour, then egg, and finally seasoned Panko.
Pour melted butter into the bottom of the 9x13 (22cm x 33cm) inch pan.
Place each coated piece of chicken skin side down in the butter.
Bake for 1 hour at 350˚F (175˚C) (times and temperatures may vary depending on the oven), flipping the chicken over halfway through.
Enjoy!
