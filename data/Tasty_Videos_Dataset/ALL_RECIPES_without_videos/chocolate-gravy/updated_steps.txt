Sift the sugar, cocoa powder, flour, and salt into a large skillet or saucepan.
Add the milk and whisk to combine.
Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, 7-10 minutes.
Remove from the heat.
Stir in the vanilla and butter until the butter is melted and well incorporated.
Serve immediately over buttermilk biscuits, pound cake, ice cream, or as a dip for your favorite fruit.
Enjoy!
