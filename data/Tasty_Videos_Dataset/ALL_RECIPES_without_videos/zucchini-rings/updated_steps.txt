Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray or line with parchment paper.
Cut each zucchini crosswise into ½-inch (1 cm) slices.
Use a 1-inch (2 cm) round cookie cutter to punch out the center of each zucchini slice.
In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.
Add the eggs to a separate bowl and whisk.
Add the flour to a third bowl.
Dredge the zucchini rings in the flour, then the eggs, then finally in the bread crumb mixture, making sure to coat all sides.
Arrange the zucchini rings on the baking sheet.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown on both sides.
Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
