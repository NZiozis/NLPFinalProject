Place the cashews in a medium bowl and cover with cold water. Let the cashews soak for at least for 4 hours, or overnight, until soft.
Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse together the pecans, almond flour, dates, cinnamon, coconut oil, and a pinch of salt. Pulse until the pecans have been broken down into crumbs and the crust begins to stick together.
Transfer the crust to a greased and parchment paper-lined 8-inch (20 cm) springform pan. Use your fingers to press the crust into the bottom of the pan in an even layer.
Make the filling: Drain the soaked cashews and place them in the bowl of the food processor. Add the coconut milk, lemon juice, coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla. Blend until very smooth, 5-7 minutes.
Pour roughly â…” of the cashew filling over the crust. Use a spatula to gently spread the mixture to the sides, then tap and shake the pan on the counter to achieve a smooth, even layer.
Freeze the pan while preparing the strawberry layer, about 10 minutes.
Add the strawberries into the remaining cashew mixture in the food processor and puree until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 5 minutes.
Scrape the strawberry filling over the first layer. Use a spatula to gently push the layer out to the sides of the pan and tap and shake the pan on the counter to achieve a smooth, even layer.
Top the cheesecake with sliced strawberries.
Freeze the cheesecake until solid, at least 4 hours.
To serve, let the cheesecake thaw at room temperature for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
Enjoy!
