In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the simple syrup, orange juice, and vanilla. Simmer for 5 minutes, until slightly reduced. Remove from the heat and let cool completely.
Once the syrup is cool, strain into an airtight glass container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
To make the soda, pour 1 cup (240 ml) of seltzer water into a glass filled with ice and add 1-2 tablespoons of syrup. Stir to combine. Garnish with orange wheels, if desired.
