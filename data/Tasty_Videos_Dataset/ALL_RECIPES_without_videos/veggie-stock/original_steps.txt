Collect veggie scraps in a resealable container and freeze for up to 6 months.
When you have enough scraps to make stock, add the scraps to a large pot and cover with water.
Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 30 minutes, up to 3 hours.
Strain the stock and transfer the liquid to resealable containers.
Refrigerate for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
Enjoy!
