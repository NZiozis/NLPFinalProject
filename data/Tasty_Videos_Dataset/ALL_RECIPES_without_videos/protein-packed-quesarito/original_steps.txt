Make the avocado dressing: in a blender, combine the avocado, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, pepper, salt, and water, and blend until smooth.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté until translucent, 3 minutes.
Add the garlic, tofu, paprika, cumin, and chili powder, and stir to combine. Add the soy sauce, stir, and cook for 3 minutes more, until tofu mixture is evenly heated.
Transfer the tofu to a medium bowl and set aside.
Add more oil to the pan if needed, then add the sweet potatoes, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Stir, cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, until sweet potatoes are tender.
Remove the sweet potato from the pan and set aside.
Add the chickpeas, garlic powder, chili powder, remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes, until the chickpeas are crispy.
Remove chickpeas and set aside.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, add a tortilla to the pan and sprinkle with ½ cup cheese, then cover with another tortilla. Cook until the cheese melts, about 3 minutes, flipping once halfway through. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and cheese.
Transfer the tortillas to plates and fill with with spinach, tofu, tomatoes, black beans, corn, sweet potatoes, and chickpeas. Drizzle with avocado dressing.
Fold in the left and right sides of the tortillas and roll up from the bottom, tucking the bottom edges under the filling.
Enjoy!
