In a large bowl combine mashed potatoes, bacon, chives, parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Spray a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray.
Divide the mashed potatoes evenly into each cup. Make a hole in the center of each mashed potato cup.
Add shredded cheddar to the center of each cup.
Bake mashed potato cups at 400ºF (200ºC) for 30-35 minutes or until outside is crispy and brown.
Top with a dollop of sour cream, chives and bacon crumbs.
Enjoy!
