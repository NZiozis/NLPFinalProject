Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In an 8-inch (20cm) square parchment paper-lined baking dish, arrange the biscuits side by side to cover the bottom of the dish, forming a sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown.
Slice the peaches, discarding the pits.
Destem and pit the cherries.
In a large skillet, combine peaches, cherries, blueberries, ½ cup (125 grams) of the sugar, water, and lemon juice. Heat to a simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, beat the heavy cream with a whisk or electric mixer until frothy. Add remaining ¼ cup (62 grams) of sugar. Continue to beat until the whipped cream forms soft peaks.
Remove the sheet of biscuits from the dish. Slice in half lengthwise, like a bagel.
Spoon the fruit mixture onto the bottom half of the biscuits, reserving some of the liquid.
Replace the top half of the biscuits. Carefully separate into individual portions (the syrup will still be quite warm!)
Spoon whipped cream over the top and drizzle with reserved fruit syrup.
Enjoy!
