Slice bread into cubes.
In a bowl, add egg, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla, and mix.
In a microwave-safe mug, place half of the cubed bread and desired amount of blueberries.
Place the rest of the bread, berries, and the egg mixture into the mug.
Microwave for 1Â½ minutes or until egg is fully cooked.
Drizzle maple syrup.
Enjoy!
