In a saucepan set over medium heat, warm the heavy cream and Â¾ cup caramel sauce, and bring to a simmer.
Place chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl, and pour on top the top cream mixture.
Allow to stand for 1 minute before stirring to combine.
Using a cookie scoop, spoon the mixture into a silicone mini muffin pan.
Chill in the freeze for 20 minutes.
Drizzle tops with remaining caramel sauce and a sprinkle of sea salt flakes.
Insert a popsicle stick into the middle of each.
Freeze for 2 hours, or refrigerate for 4 hours.
To serve, dissolve a stick into a mug of hot milk.
Enjoy!
