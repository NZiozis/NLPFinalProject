Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Add the onion, green pepper, cilantro, and garlic. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add the cooking wine, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, sofrito, recaito, Spanish olives, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
Add the stew beef. Increase the heat to high and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the meat is cooked through.
Add the chicken broth and water. Stir to combine. Add the chicken, corn, potatoes, and yuca. Stir well. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the potatoes are softened.
Reduce the heat to low and add the plantains. Simmer uncovered for 15 minutes, until the plantains are tender.
Garnish the soup with cilantro and serve with halved avocados, rice, and lime wedges, if desired.
Enjoy!
