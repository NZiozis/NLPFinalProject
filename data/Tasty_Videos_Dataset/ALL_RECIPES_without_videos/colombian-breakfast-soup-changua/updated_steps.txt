Heat water and milk in a pot over medium heat.
Bring to a boil and add 4 eggs.
Without stirring, add green onions and tomatoes.
Let eggs cook for about 5 minutes, or until the egg yolks are just barely firm.
Salt to taste (optional).
Serve one egg per bowl and add broth.
Garnish with cilantro and use bread to dip - we used sourdough, but any bread will do.
Enjoy!
