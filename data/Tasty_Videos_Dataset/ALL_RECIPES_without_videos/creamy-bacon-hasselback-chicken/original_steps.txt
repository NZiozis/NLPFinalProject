Slice into the chicken several times, about ½ cm (¼ inch) apart, but only cut about 85% of the way through, leaving the bottom intact.
Cook the bacon over a medium heat until it starts to get crispy.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Stir in the spring onions and cook for another minute or so.
Add the cream cheese and cook until melted.
Allow filling to cool to the touch, and then fill each segment of the chicken breast with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture.
Bake in the centre of the oven for 18-22 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear.
Enjoy!
