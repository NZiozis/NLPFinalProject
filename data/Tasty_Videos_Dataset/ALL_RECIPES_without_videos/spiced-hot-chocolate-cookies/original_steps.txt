Beat brown sugar, white sugar, and eggs.
Melt the unsweetened chocolate and butter, allow to cool. Mix into the egg and sugar mixture.
Add all of the dry ingredients, and mix thoroughly (you don’t want any cayenne pepper clumps!).
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Space out 12 cookies on a baking sheet.
Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 13 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven.
Top each one with a large marshmallow.
Broil for 30 seconds, until the marshmallows have just started to brown.
Enjoy!
