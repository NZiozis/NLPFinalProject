Grease a waffle iron with melted butter or nonstick spray. Set the heat to medium.
In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, milk, vinegar, sugar, and egg. Add the flour, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper and whisk to incorporate. Fold in the cheddar cheese with a rubber spatula.
Pour 1 scant cup (260 G) of batter onto the waffle iron and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter.
Serve the waffles warm and topped with chili, more cheddar cheese, sour cream, and green onions.
Enjoy!
