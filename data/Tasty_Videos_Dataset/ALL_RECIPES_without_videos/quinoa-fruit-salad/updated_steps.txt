In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the water and orange juice to a boil.
Add the quinoa, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes, until the quinoa is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
Set aside.
Add the lemon juice and agave to a large mason jar and stir to combine.
Add the blueberries, strawberries, banana, blackberries, and cooked quinoa to the jar and screw on the lid.
Store in the refrigerator until ready to eat, up to 5 days
Give the mason jar a good shake to mix and use a fork or spoon to stir as needed.
Enjoy!
