Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium- high heat. Add the chicken, paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, Cajun seasoning, cayenne, and salt. Stir to coat.
Once chicken is fully cooked, about 5 minutes, add the sausages and cook for 3 minutes.
Remove the chicken and sausage from the pot and set aside.
Using the same pot, add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pot. Add the onion, celery, green pepper, jalape√±o, garlic, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook until vegetables are soft and tender, scraping any brown bits on the bottom of the pot, about 8-10 minutes.
Add chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, cooked rice, and bay leaves. Stir well and add the chicken and sausage back into the pot. Bring to a simmer.
Put the lid on and continue simmering for 10 minutes.
Stir in the shrimp. Put the lid back on and cook for 5 minutes, or until shrimp are cooked through.
Enjoy!
