Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half.
If the squash is too tough, puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash.
Microwave for 3-5 minutes to soften.
Allow to cool before cutting in half.
Scoop out the seeds, brush with oil, and sprinkle with salt, and pepper.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a fork can easily pierce the skin.
Meanwhile, combine water, soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, lime juice, Sriracha, peanut butter, ginger, and garlic in a bowl, stirring to combine.
Remove squash from the oven, with a fork pull at the edges to produce that stringy “spaghetti” quality.
In a bowl combine “spaghetti” with cucumber, carrots, peppers, green onions, onions, peanuts, cilantro, and sauce.
Add mixture back to the hollowed out spaghetti squash halves.
Serve in the squash, and top garnish with cilantro and peanuts.
Enjoy!
