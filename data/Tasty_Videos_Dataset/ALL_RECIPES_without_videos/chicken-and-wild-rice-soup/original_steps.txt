In a large bowl, combine the chicken thighs with the garlic powder, thyme, dried parsley, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Toss until well coated.
In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, cook the chicken until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to cool for 5 minutes, then shred with 2 forks into small pieces.
To the same pot, add the butter, carrots, celery, onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook over medium heat until the veggies are soft, 5-10 minutes. Remove from the pot and set aside.
Add the wild rice and 3½ cups of chicken broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the rice is tender.
Once the rice is cooked, stir in the Parmesan, cooked vegetables, heavy cream, and remaining 4½ cups of broth. Bring to a boil. Stir in the sour cream, fresh parsley, and shredded chicken.
Serve warm topped with more Parmesan.
Enjoy!
