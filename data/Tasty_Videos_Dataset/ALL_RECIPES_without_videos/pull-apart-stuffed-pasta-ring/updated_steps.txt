Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Mix all the ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, oregano, garlic, basil, chili flakes (optional), salt, and pepper until smooth.
Unfold a jumbo shell, turning it inside out, and gently fill it with 1-2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture.
Refold the shell and set aside.
Repeat with the rest of the pasta shells.
In a circular dish, place a layer of marinara sauce that completely covers the bottom of the pan.
Place the shells, cheese side up in the pan in a spiralling pattern.
Pour a little extra marinara sauce within the spiral and top the whole pan with mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is a golden brown.
Pull apart with your fingers.
Enjoy!
