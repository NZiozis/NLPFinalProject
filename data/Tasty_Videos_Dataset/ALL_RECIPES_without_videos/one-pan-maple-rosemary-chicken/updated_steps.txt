Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
To the baking sheet, add the purple potatoes, Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, butternut squash, apple, and red onion.
In a small bowl, whisk together the Dijon mustard, maple syrup, garlic, rosemary, and lemon juice.
Lay the chicken thighs skin-side down on top of the vegetables.
Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then brush with about ⅓ of Dijon-maple mixture.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until juices from the chicken run clear.
Optional: Broil for 2-3 minutes to brown and crisp the chicken skin.
Serve the chicken with the vegetables.
Enjoy!
