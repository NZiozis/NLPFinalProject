Peel bananas and cut in half.
Place popsicle sticks inside bananas and put on tray with parchment paper.
Freeze for 1 to 3 hours, depending on how firm you want your bananas to be.
Heat white chocolate chips in microwave at 30 second intervals until liquified.
Coat bananas in white chocolate and sprinkle with rainbow sprinkles.
Chocolate will harden so move quickly!
Serve immediately or set aside and freeze for an additional 10 minutes.
Enjoy!
