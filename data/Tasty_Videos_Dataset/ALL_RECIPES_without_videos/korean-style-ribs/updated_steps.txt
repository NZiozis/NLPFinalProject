Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl.
Pour marinade over ribs and let them marinate for at least four hours.
After marinating, place ribs on baking dish.
Reserve the marinade for later.
Bake ribs at 325°F (160°C) for two and a half to three hours.
Pour the leftover marinade into a saucepan, add the honey, and bring to a boil to form a glaze.
Set aside.
After two and half to three hours, remove the ribs from the oven.
Pour the glaze over the ribs and broil for 5 to 10 minutes.
Cut up the ribs, sprinkle sesame seeds over, and garnish with scallions.
Enjoy!
