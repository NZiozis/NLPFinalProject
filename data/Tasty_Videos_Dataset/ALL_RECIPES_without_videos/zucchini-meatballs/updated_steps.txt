Remove each end of the zucchinis and use a cheese grater to shred into a large mixing bowl.
Sprinkle salt over shredded zucchini, toss, and let rest for 20 minutes to pull out excess moisture.
Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Using a dish towel/cloth squeeze out excess liquid from the shredded zucchini.
Move the zucchini to a dry mixing bowl and add the remaining ingredients.
Stir until evenly mixed and form into golf ball-sized balls.
Bake in a preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or until browned, flipping halfway through.
Serve over pasta with your choice of sauce.
Enoy!
