In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar together until smooth.
Pour in the heavy cream and beat until the mixture has reached soft peaks.
Add in the strawberries and beat until well-incorporated.
Pour the mixture into 6 popsicle molds and insert popsicle sticks.
Freeze at least 8 hours.
Place vanilla wafers in a gallon-size freezer bag and smash with a rolling pin until the the cookies have broken down into crumbs.
Coat the popsicles with egg wash, then with vanilla wafer crumbs and repeat for a second coating.
Freeze for another 30 minutes.
While holding the end of the popsicle stick, dip the popsicle into the oil, heated to 375°F (190°C), and hold for 10 seconds. Be sure to wear heat-resistant gloves when frying the popsicles! Or use a reliable pair of tongs to hold the stick while frying.
Immediately after pulling the popsicle from the oil, pat both sides with a paper towel to absorb excess oil.
Freeze immediately until ready to serve.
Enjoy!
