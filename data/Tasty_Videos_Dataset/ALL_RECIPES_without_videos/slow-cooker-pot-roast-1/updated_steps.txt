In a slow cooker, add the potatoes, carrots, and onions to make a base for the meat.
Lay the chuck roast on top of the veggies and season with salt and pepper on both sides.
Wash your hands, because mess.
Mix cornstarch and water until well combined and pour close to the edge so it gets down to the veggies.
Pour Worcestershire sauce directly on top of the meat.
Cover with the slow-cooker lid and cook on high for 5 hours.
Place the rosemary and thyme sprigs on top of the meat and cook for 1 more hour.
Remove rosemary and thyme.
Using a fork, shred the meat and serve by itself with the veggies, or on top of bread for a sandwich!
The juices from the bottom of the slow cooker make for an AMAZING dipping sauce!
Enjoy!
