Spread the chocolate hazelnut spread evenly over the tortilla.
Place the banana and strawberry slices on the top half of the tortilla.
Fold the tortilla in half from the bottom, then fold in the sides, being careful not to tear the tortilla.
Toast on medium-high, until golden brown.
Watch to make sure it doesnâ€™t burn.
Let cool for 1-2 minutes before removing from the toaster.
Enjoy!
