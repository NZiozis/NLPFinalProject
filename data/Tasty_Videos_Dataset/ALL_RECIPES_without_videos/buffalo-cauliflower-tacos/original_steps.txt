Preheat oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
On a cutting board, break the head of cauliflower into florets.
In a large mixing bowl, add flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and milk, and stir until well combined.
Add cauliflower florets to batter, making sure each piece is evenly coated.
Transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway.
In a small mixing bowl, combine hot sauce, vegetable oil, and honey, and stir until evenly combined.
Brush hot sauce mixture on cauliflower and bake for an additional 20 minutes.
Serve on warm tortillas with desired taco toppings.
Enjoy!
