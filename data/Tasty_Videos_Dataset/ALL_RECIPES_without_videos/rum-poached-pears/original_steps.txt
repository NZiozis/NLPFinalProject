Peel the pears and cut the bottoms out, but leave the stems intact.
Mix the water, sugar, rum, and vanilla in a large pot. Set to medium heat.
Add the pears. Cover with a lid and simmer for about 40 minutes, turning occasionally. Cook until soft and golden (this can take less time depending on the ripeness of your pears.
Scoop out the pears and place upright on a dish. At this point you can cook the liquid longer until it becomes a syrup, or ladle a small amount directly onto the pears right away.
Add optional ice cream.
Melt some dark chocolate and spoon it onto the pear or your favorite toppings like nuts!
Enjoy!
