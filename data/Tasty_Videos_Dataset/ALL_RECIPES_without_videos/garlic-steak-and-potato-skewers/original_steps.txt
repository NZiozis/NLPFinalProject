In a bowl, season the steak with garlic, salt, and pepper, and stir thoroughly.
On soaked bamboo sticks, skewer on the seasoned steak cubes, then potatos and onions.
Repeat until the skewer is full.
On a coal BBQ, cook the steak skewers for 2-3 minutes a side for medium-rare and 4-5 minutes for well done.
Enjoy!
