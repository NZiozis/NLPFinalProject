NOTE: If you have unroasted nuts, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread cashews onto a baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes or until you can smell them.
In a food processor, blend raw cashews. Scrape down the sides when necessary. Nuts should turn into a ball then even out.
Once the mixture looks creamy, add unsweetened coconut flakes and coconut oil.
Blend until well combined.
Pour into a jar, store in a refrigerator and use within one month.
Enjoy!
