Mix onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, parsley, and water in small bowl or measuring cup.
Place the potatoes in a large, gallon-sized freezer bag.
Top with the carrots, onion, and pot roast.
Pour marinade over all the contents of the bag.
Seal freezer bag and ensure excess air is squeezed out.
Gently mix contents together so that the marinade reaches the potatoes.
Place in freezer and store up to 3 months.
When ready to enjoy, thaw completely and pour contents into slow cooker.
Cook on low for 8 hours, or high for 4 hours, or until roast is cooked and tender.
Enjoy!
