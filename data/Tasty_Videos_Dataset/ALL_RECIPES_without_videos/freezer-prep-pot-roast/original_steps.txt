Mix the onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, parsley, and water in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup.
Place the potatoes in a large, gallon-sized freezer bag. Add the carrots, onion, and chuck roast.
Pour the marinade over the contents in the bag. Seal the freezer bag and squeeze out any excess air. Gently mix the contents together so that the marinade reaches the potatoes.
Freeze for up to 3 months.
When ready to enjoy, thaw completely and pour the contents into slow cooker.
Cook on low for 8 hours, or high for 4 hours, or until the roast is cooked through and tender.
Enjoy!
