Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Using a hand mixer or standing mixer, combine cheese, butter, and salt in a large bowl.
Once combined, mix in the flour and add the ice water one tablespoon at a time.
The dough should hold together but crumble apart if you break it up in your hand. If it seems too dry, add a little more ice water.
Separate dough into two halves and pack together into discs. Wrap in parchment paper and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Roll out dough to ⅛ of an inch (½ cm), pinching the cracks on the ends.
Cut into 1 inch x 1 inch (2 ½ x 2 ½ cm) squares and pierce a hole in the middle of each square for ventilation during baking.
Place the separated crackers on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 13 minutes, or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
