Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Use a fork to pierce holes all over the sweet potatoes.
Microwave the potatoes for 7 minutes until they have softened significantly.
Slice the potatoes in half and use a spoon to scrape out the inner flesh, making sure to leave at least a ¼-inch (6 mm) thick border on each side, saving the scooped out potato parts to use for side dishes.
Transfer the potatoes to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Fill each of the potatoes with 1 egg and an assortment of fillings for whatever flavor combinations you’d like.
Season each potatoes with salt and pepper.
Bake for 8-12 minutes, until the egg has cooked to preferred doneness.
Top the potatoes and side dishes with your choice of topping and garnishes and serve.
Enjoy!
