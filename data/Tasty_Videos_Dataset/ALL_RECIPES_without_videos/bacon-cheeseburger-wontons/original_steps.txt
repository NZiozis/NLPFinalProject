Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Fry the onion, garlic, bacon and mince until cooked and transfer into a large bowl.
Add the mozzarella, gherkins and mustard, and mix well. Set filling aside.
In a large bowl, make a well in the flour and slowly mix in the beaten egg and water until combined. Knead for 5-10 minutes then leave in a warm place to rest for 1-2 hours.
Once rested, knead for another minute, then divide dough into 4. Roll out each piece until it is a 7x7 inch (18x18 cm), then cut into 4.
Put 1 tbsp of the filling into each square, brush the sides with water and then fold into triangles. Repeat for all the dough.
Oil a baking tray and cook wontons for 8-10 minutes at your oven’s highest temperature.
To make the sauce, mix together the mayo, ketchup, and mustard.
Serve and enjoy!
