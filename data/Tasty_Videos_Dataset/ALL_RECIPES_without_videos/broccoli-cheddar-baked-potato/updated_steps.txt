Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Carefully pierce potatoes with a fork.
On a baking sheet oil the potatoes well and sprinkle with salt.
Bake for about one hour.
If making more potatoes, an additional 15 minutes per potato is needed.
Once cooled, cut the potatoes vertically, scoop out the inside, and transfer to a bowl.
In the bowl with the scooped out potatoes, add the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, broccoli, salt, pepper, and milk.
Mix well.
Scoop the potato mixture back into the potatoes and top with cheddar cheese.
Bake an additional 15 minutes until the cheese is melted.
Serve warm with sour cream and chives.
Enjoy!
