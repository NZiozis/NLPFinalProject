Add cashews to a small bowl and cover with boiling water and soak for 1 hour.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat.
Add onion and garlic, and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes.
Add carrots and chiles.
Continue to cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the onions are translucent and the chiles are tender.
Add cumin and chili powders, and stir well to coat the vegetables.
Increase heat to medium-high and add the vegetable stock.
Bring to a simmer before covering and cooking for 15 minutes.
Once the carrots are tender, transfer to a blender.
Add the soaked cashews, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, and milk alternative to the blender on top of the saut√©ed vegetables.
Puree until smooth and creamy, adding more milk alternative to adjust the consistency if necessary.
Pour mixture into a shallow bowl or serving dish.
Garnish with additional chiles and freshly chopped cilantro.
Serve with tortilla chips.
Enjoy!
