In a large skillet, add chicken breast and season both sides with salt and pepper.
Cook 15-18 minutes, flipping halfway and adding the onions when you flip the chicken. (Cooking times may vary depending on thickness of the chicken breast).
Remove the chicken from the pan and continue to stir onions.
Shred the chicken while onions are cooking.
Return the shredded chicken to the pan with the onions. Add the BBQ sauce and stir. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Place a tortilla in a pan and add a layer monterey jack and cheddar cheese on half of the tortilla.
Place cooked chicken and onions, and top with the rest of each cheese. Fold in half and cook 6 minutes, flipping halfway.
Serve with extra BBQ sauce and garnish with fresh parsley.
Enjoy!
