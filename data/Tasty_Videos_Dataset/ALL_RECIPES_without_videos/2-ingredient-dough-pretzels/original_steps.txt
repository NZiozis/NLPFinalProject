Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a large bowl, mix the self-rising flour and greek yogurt until it comes together to form a ball.
Transfer the dough ball to a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to begin flattening and shaping the rough into a roughly 8-inch (20 cm) disk.
Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into 8 equal pieces.
One at a time, roll each piece out into a roughly 14-inch (35 cm) log.
Transfer the logs to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and shape into individual pretzels.
Brush the pretzels with egg wash and sprinkle with salt.
Bake for 20 minutes, until the pretzels are a deep golden brown.
Enjoy!
