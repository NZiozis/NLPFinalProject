Season the chicken with pepper and cumin powder to taste.
On a medium-low heat, cook the chicken in some oil with the onion for 3 to 4 minutes stirring and turning occasionally.
Add the cherry tomatoes, the water, the chickpeas, the harissa paste, the honey and the courgette.
Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce slightly thickens.
Enjoy!
