Preheat oven to 400º F (200º C).
On a cutting board, halve the squash vertically.
Scoop out the seeds, and peel the squash.
Cut the squash into ½-inch (12 mm) half moons, then cut into ¼-inch (6 mm) fries or wedges.
In a bowl, toss the fries with oil, salt, and pepper, then transfer to a baking tray.
Bake for 20-35 minutes, flipping halfway through.
Enjoy!
