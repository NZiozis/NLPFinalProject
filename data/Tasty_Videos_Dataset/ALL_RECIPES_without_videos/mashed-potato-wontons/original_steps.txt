Add the potatoes, garlic cloves, and 1 teaspoon of salt to a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, until the potatoes are fork-tender.
Drain the potatoes and garlic in a colander, and transfer to a bowl.
Use a fork or potato masher to mash the potatoes.
Add ½ tablespoon of butter, sour cream, Parmesan, and 2 teaspoons of salt to the potatoes and stir to combine.
In a small pan, on medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the shallot, a pinch of salt, and pepper and stir.
Once the shallots are golden brown, add the thyme and remove from the heat.
Add the shallot mixture to the bowl of potatoes and mix to combine.
Place 1 tablespoon of the potato mixture in the center of a wonton wrapper. Wet the tip of your finger and brush the edges of the wrapper, folding it in half on the diagonal, pressing down to secure both sides. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture.
In a large pot, heat oil to 350˚F (180˚F).
Fry the wontons in small batches until golden brown.
Transfer the wontons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Serve with sour cream.
Enjoy!
