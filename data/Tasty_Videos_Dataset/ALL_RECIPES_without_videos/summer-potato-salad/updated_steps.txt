Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm).
Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
Once boiling, uncover, add the salt and corn, and reduce the heat to medium.
Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the potatoes and the corn are tender.
Drain.
Add the potatoes to a large bowl.
Combine 2 tablespoons of pickle juice with the mustard and pour it over the still-warm potatoes.
Toss to coat.
Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to an hour.
Dice the red bell pepper, removing the ribs and seeds.
Set a medium bowl upside down in a large bowl and stand a corn cob on the inverted bowl.
Cut the corn kernels from the cobs, letting them fall into the larger bowl.
In a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise, remaining tablespoon of pickle juice, paprika, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth.
Add the bell pepper, corn, celery, pickles, red onion, green onions, and dill to the bowl with the potatoes.
Pour the sauce over and toss to coat.
Sprinkle the potato salad with chopped chives, for garnish.
Enjoy!
