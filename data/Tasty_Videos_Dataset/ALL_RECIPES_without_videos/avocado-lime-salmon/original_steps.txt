Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
On a baking sheet, season salmon with garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika.
Bake for 10-12 minutes.
In a small bowl, mix avocado topping ingredients until fully incorporated. Don’t overmix or you’ll break down your avocado.
Spoon avocado topping over the salmon.
Enjoy!
