For the dressing, push a straw through the strawberries from the tip to the green top to remove the hull.
(Or you can cut it off with a knife!)
Add the rest of the dressing ingredients.
Blend until smooth.
Refrigerate.
Cut strawberries, apple, and onion into slices.
Combine all the salad ingredients in a large bowl.
Drizzle with desired amount of dressing and toss to coat.
(Spinach wilts easily, donâ€™t add dressing until ready to eat!)
Sprinkle feta cheese on top and serve.
Enjoy!
