Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Flip a baking sheet upside down and place a piece of parchment paper on top. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and Club House ranch dip seasoning. Stir until well mixed. Fold in the spinach. Set aside.
Roll out the tube of pizza dough on a piece of parchment paper set on a flat surface. Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut from a bottom corner to the center of the top. Repeat on the other side so you have 1 full triangle and 2 halves of a triangle on either side.
Transfer both side-triangle pieces to the prepared baking sheet. Pinch the middle seam to seal and stretch the dough to form a single triangle.
Spread the spinach dip over a side of the triangle.
Spread the pesto over the other side of the triangle.
Flip the remaining dough triangle on top of the filling and remove the parchment from the top. Stretch the dough to cover completely.
Using a pizza cutter or knife, make horizontal slices about 1 inch apart from the top to bottom, leaving the middle “trunk” of the tree intact.
Pull the strips outwards and twist.
In a small bowl, mix the melted butter and garlic and brush over the tree.
Sprinkle with the Club House Italian herbs and shredded Parmesan cheese.
Bake the tree for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and the cheese has melted.
Serve with marinara sauce.
Enjoy!
