Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Lightly flour a clean surface.
Roll out the pizza dough and cut into 4 strips, then cut each strip into 8 triangles.
Transfer the triangles to the prepared baking sheet.
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, oregano, garlic powder and crushed red pepper.
Brush the seasoned oil over the pizza dough triangles.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until the chips are crispy and golden brown.
Remove the chips from the oven and leave the oven on.
Layer half of the chips in a large cast iron skillet or on a baking sheet.
Spoon on half of the marinara sauce, then top with half of the mozzarella, pepperoni, Italian sausage, and tomatoes.
Layer on the remaining ingredients.
Bake for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
Top the nachos with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the basil, then serve.
Enjoy!
