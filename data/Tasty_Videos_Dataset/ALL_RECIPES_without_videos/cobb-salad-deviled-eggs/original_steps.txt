Place the eggs in a large pot and cover with 1 inch (2 cm) of cold water.
Bring to a rolling boil, cover with the lid, and remove from heat. Let the eggs sit, covered for 8-10 minutes.
Remove from water and immediately place in bath of ice water for a few minutes.
Remove shells and cut the egg in half, vertically.
Remove the yolk and place in a bowl. Set the cooked whites aside on a serving tray.
In the bowl with the yolks, add salt, pepper, tomatoes, chicken, bacon, mayonnaise, and mustard.
Mash until everything is well incorporated.
Gently fold in the diced avocado.
Fill each cooked egg white with the mixture, and if you would like to get fancy, garnish with blue cheese and a small strip of bacon.
Enjoy!
