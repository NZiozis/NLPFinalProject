In a medium-sized pan on medium high heat melt 3 tablespoons butter and add shallots.
Cook for 3-4 minutes.
Add garlic and 1 more tablespoons of butter into pan and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add milk, white pepper, and salt to pan and stir until incorporated.
Transfer the shallot mixture to a food processor and process into a paste.
Mash potatoes and incorporate shallot mixture and continue to mash until fully incorporated.
Add olive oil to a large pan over medium heat and add in the mushrooms, cooking for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the asparagus to the pan and season with salt and pepper, cooking for 5 minutes.
On a cutting board, cut 4 slits into salmon skin roughly a ¼-inch (6 mm) apart, and ½-inch (12 mm) into the salmon.
Season salmon with salt, pepper, and thyme.
Add olive oil to a medium pan on medium-high heat and place the salmon skin-side down.
Cook for 3-4 minutes or until a lighter pink color has reached ⅓-½ of the way up the side of the salmon.
Flip salmon and immediately add the butter, garlic, and thyme.
Stir the garlic and thyme around the pan to infuse the flavors and spoon the butter onto salmon.
Allow salmon to cook through, roughly 2 more minutes.
Transfer the salmon to a paper towel-lined plate.
Add the potato puree to a plate, and top with mushrooms, asparagus, and salmon.
Enjoy!
