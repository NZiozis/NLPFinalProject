Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Combine the egg and the lemon juice.
In a separate bowl, combine the panko bread crumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, lemon zest, salt, and pepper.
Coat the chicken tenders in flour and shake off any excess.
Then dredge in the egg and lemon juice mixture and allow excess egg to drip off.
Coat with the panko bread crumb mixture, turning until evenly coated.
Lay chicken tenders flat on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.
Spray additional cooking spray over the chicken tenders to help them brown.
Bake for 20-25 minutes (or until browned and chicken is cooked all the way through), flipping once halfway through.
Serve with your favorite dip and some veggies for a fun appetizer or with garlic Parmesan roasted vegetables for dinner!
Enjoy!
