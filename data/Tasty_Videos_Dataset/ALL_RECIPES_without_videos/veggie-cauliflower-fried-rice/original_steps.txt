Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets.
Place the florets in a food processor and blend until they are a rice-like texture. Be careful not to over process or it may turn mushy. Set aside, and drain excess moisture with a towel, if desired.
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, salt, and pepper until vegetables are tender but not soft.
Add the cauliflower rice. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are incorporated evenly into the cauliflower.
Spread the rice towards the edge of the pan, creating a well in the center. Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked.
Fold the eggs into the rice.
Enjoy!
