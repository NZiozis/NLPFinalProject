Preheat oven at 350°F (180°C).
Mix the ground meat with the onion, parsley, egg, garlic, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and cumin.
Grab a tablespoon of beef, place ½ tablespoon of cream cheese and cover it with the beef to make a meatball.
Add oil to a pan and cook the meatballs over low heat, let cool and remove excess fat.
In a muffin tin, place a spoonful of macaroni and cheese and distribute to make a cup, place a meatball in the center and add more macaroni on top.
Add Parmesan cheese to taste.
Bake for 20 minutes.
Enjoy!
