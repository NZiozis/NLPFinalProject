Season the onion, garlic, and celery with salt and pepper, and cook in a little oil until softened.
Stir in the vodka and lemon juice.
Add the can of chopped tomatoes, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, then simmer for a few minutes.
Add the sauce to a blender and whizz until smooth.
Serving suggestions: This is a great replacement for any other tomato-based sauce. Use it as a pizza sauce, over pasta, or in a bake! Will keep in the fridge for up to one week!
Enjoy!
