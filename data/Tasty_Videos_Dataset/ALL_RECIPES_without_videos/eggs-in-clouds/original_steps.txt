Separate the yolk from egg whites.
In a chilled metal bowl, whisk the whites until stiff peaks form. Mix in whatever you want. We use bacon, chives and parmesan cheese.
Spoon the whites into even piles on a baking sheet and create a well in the center of each pile with the back of the spoon.
Bake at 450째F (230째C) for 3 minutes.
Put a yolk in each well, bake another 3 minutes at 450째F (230째C).
Enjoy!
