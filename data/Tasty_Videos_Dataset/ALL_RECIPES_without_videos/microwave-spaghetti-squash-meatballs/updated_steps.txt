Slice the spaghetti squash in half.
If youâ€™re having difficult, poke some holes with a knife, then microwave for 5 minutes.
Scoop out the seeds and innards with a spoon, then rub oil, salt, and pepper all over the surface.
Microwave for about 10-15 minutes until the squash is tender and pulls away from the skin easily.
Using a fork, shred the squash into noodle-like strands.
Microwave the meatballs with the pasta sauce, covered, for about 2 minutes or until the meatballs are fully heated through.
Spoon the meatballs and sauce on top of each spaghetti squash half, garnish with the Parmesan and parsley.
Enjoy!
