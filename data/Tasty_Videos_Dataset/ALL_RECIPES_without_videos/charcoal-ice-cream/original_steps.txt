In a large freezer bag, place a piece of dry ice. Close the plastic bag, but leave a one-inch opening to prevent the bag from fill with gas.
Cover the bag with a kitchen towel and carefully use a kitchen mallet to break the dry ice into a powder.
In a large bowl, combine heavy cream, half & half, sugar, activate charcoal (avoid consuming more than 100 grams of activated charcoal), 2 tablespoons mint extract, and at least 4 tablespoons black food coloring (more food coloring might be needed depending on concentration).
Whisk together ice cream mixture until frothy.
Slowly add a spoonful of dry ice into the mixture and whisk together. Gradually add and mix in dry ice until a solid consistency is achieved.
Wait for all the dry ice to evaporate before consuming. Do not eat solid dry ice.
For best results, eat within 24 hours.
