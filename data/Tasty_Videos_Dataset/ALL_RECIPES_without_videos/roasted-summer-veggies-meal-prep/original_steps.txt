Preheat the oven at 350°F (180°C).
While it’s heating, chop zucchini, eggplant, onion, and garlic.
Then toss them in a large bowl with salt, pepper, and oil. Transfer to a foil-lined sheet tray.
Bake for 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, score a small ‘X’ into the bottom of each tomato and microwave them in a bowl for 7 to 10 minutes.
Once cooled, peel the skin off and roughly dice them.
After 40 minutes of cooking, increase oven to 400°F (205°C), add the tomatoes, and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
Let cool, then store in covered container in fridge.
Enjoy!
