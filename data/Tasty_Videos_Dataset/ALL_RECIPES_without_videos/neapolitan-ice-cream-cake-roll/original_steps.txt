Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with nonstick spray.
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until pale and foamy, about 2 minutes.
Add the sugar, oil, and vanilla. Whisk again until incorporated.
Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
Mix with a spatula until combined.
Pour the batter onto the baking sheet.
Bake for 12 minutes until the cake is set.
Lay out a kitchen towel and sprinkle with cocoa powder.
Once the cake is done, invert it onto the towel, remove the parchment, and lift the towel to roll the cake into a log. The towel will wrap into the cake.
Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour to cool.
Place the cake on the counter and unroll.
Place ice cream scoops on the cake in an even line, starting with chocolate, then the strawberry and vanilla.
Smooth each line of ice cream out, being careful not to mix the flavors.
Tightly roll the cake back up, this time without the towel.
Freeze the cake for at least 3 hours, or overnight.
Place the chocolate chips in a medium bowl.
Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until melted and smooth.
Place the cake on a rack set over a baking sheet.
Pour the ganache over the cake in an even layer.
Place cake in the freezer for 30 minutes, or until the ganache is set.
Enjoy!
