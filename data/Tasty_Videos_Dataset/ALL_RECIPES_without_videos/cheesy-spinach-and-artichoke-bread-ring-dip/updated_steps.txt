Coat a 10 inch (25cm) oven-safe skillet with olive oil.
Place the dinner roll dough balls in a ring around the skillet.
Cover and let rise until thawed and doubled in size.
In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, parmesan, romano, mozzarella, sour cream, artichoke hearts, spinach, garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes.
Once the dough has thawed, uncover and scoop the dip into the center of the skillet.
Brush the rolls with olive oil, and top with an additional sprinkle of cheese (optional).
Bake in a preheated oven at 375˚F (190˚C) for 25 minutes.
(If the bread browns too quickly, lower oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) or cover the bread with a ring of foil).
Remove and let cool slightly before serving.
Enjoy!
