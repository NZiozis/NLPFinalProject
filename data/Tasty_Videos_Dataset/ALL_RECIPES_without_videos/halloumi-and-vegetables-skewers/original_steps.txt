In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, sweet chilli sauce, salt, and pepper.
On soaked bamboo sticks, skewer on the halloumi cubes, then courgette chunks and cherry tomatoes. Repeat until the skewer is full. Brush the sweet chilli oil mix onto to skewer.
On a coal BBQ, cook the steak skewers for 2-3 minutes a side, until the cheese and vegetables are soft and turn golden brown.
Enjoy!
