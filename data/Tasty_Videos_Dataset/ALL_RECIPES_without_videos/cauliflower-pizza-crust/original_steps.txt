Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚F).
Add the cauliflower to the bowl of a food processor, and pulse until it becomes the size of rice.
Place the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 3 minutes, or until it begins to steam.
Remove the cauliflower and place on a clean kitchen towel. Wrap the towel around the cauliflower, and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Discard the liquid and transfer the cauliflower to a bowl.
Add the Parmesan, egg, salt, almond flour, and oregano to the bowl with the cauliflower. Stir to combine.
Transfer the mixture to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and use your hands to form it into a round disk, ½-inch (1 cm) thick and 10-inches (25 cm) in diameter.
Bake the crust for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the crust begins to brown.
Top the crust with marinara sauce, mozzarella, and basil, or other toppings of your choice, and bake for 10 more minutes.
Enjoy!
