Brown the Sausages on all sides in a large skillet - until mostly cooked through.
Set aside to cool slightly.
Unroll each sheet of puff pastry and cut into 4 pieces.
Spread mash over each pastry, top with cooked sausage and additional mash.
Roll up each sheet - pinch together to seal and trim off any excess.
Place on a greased baking sheet - seam side down - and brush each roll with beaten egg.
Bake in a preheated oven at 190˚C (375˚F) for 25-30 minutes - until the pastry is golden and crispy on all sides and the meat has cooked through.
Serve with a side of Onion Gravy.
Enjoy!
