In a 12-ounce (375 ml) or larger mug , mix all ingredients until just combined.
Microwave on high for 90 seconds to 2 minutes, watching to make sure it doesnâ€™t spill over (depending on the size of the mug).
Let cool one minute before eating.
Top with whipped topping and sprinkles (optional).
Enjoy!
