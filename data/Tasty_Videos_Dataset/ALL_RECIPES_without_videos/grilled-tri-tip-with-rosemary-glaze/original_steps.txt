Combine dry rub ingredients in a small bowl and stir to combine.
Evenly coat the tri tip with the dry rub and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
In a small saucepan, bring glaze ingredients to a low boil over medium heat. Simmer for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
Heat a charcoal or gas grill to the medium heat.
Grill steak for 4-5 minutes over direct heat, then flip and grill until internal temperature reaches 125°F (52°C) on a meat thermometer.
Brush the steak with the brown sugar glaze, then flip the steak and repeat, about 1 minute per side. Do this until you’ve used up about half the glaze then remove meat from the grill.
Let the steak rest for 10 minutes, then slice into ½-inch (1 cm) strips against the grain.
Serve with remaining glaze on the side for drizzling or dipping.
Enjoy!
