In a large pot or skillet, add 2 cups (470ml) of milk, pasta, salt, and pepper.
Bring it to boil, stirring constantly so the milk and pasta do not burn.
When the liquid is evaporated halfway, add the rest of the milk.
Stir until pasta is al dente.
Add shredded cheeses and mix until melted.
Take off the heat to prevent mac ‘n’ cheese from over cooking.
In a oven-safe ceramic bowl, coat the inside with butter (or oil).
Place sliced cheese until the bowl is fully covered.
Add bacon (or any desired fixins’), and add the pasta to the top.
Roll or spread out pizza dough to fit the bowl and place over the top.
In a small bowl, melt butter.
Add in garlic powder, salt, and Italian seasoning, then brush on top of dough.
Bake in a 350°F (180°C) over for 25 minutes.
Carefully place a plate over the dough and flip the bowl.
Use a butter knife or fork to separate from the bowl.
Sprinkle with parsley for garnish.
Enjoy!
