Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a bowl, add broccoli, potatoes, 1 cup (100 g) cheddar, ½ teaspoon salt salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Stir to combine.
Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) nonstick tart pan with olive oil. Pour the broccoli mixture into the pan. Press evenly into the pan and the sides of the pan until firm using a measuring cup.
Bake for 45 minutes until the potatoes begin to brown.
In a bowl, mix together the eggs, broccoli, tomatoes, onion, remaining cheddar, half-and-half, and the rest of the salt and pepper.
Pour the egg mixture into the cooked crust. Bake for 25 minutes until eggs are firm.
Let cool, then serve.
Enjoy!
