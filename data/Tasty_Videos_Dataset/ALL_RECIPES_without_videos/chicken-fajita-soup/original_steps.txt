In a 5-quart Dutch oven coated with oil, cook chicken, chili powder, cumin, and pepper for 3 minutes.
Add the garlic, onion, and bell peppers, and cook until the onions are clear.
Add the juice of 2 limes, crushed tomato, chicken broth, and cream, and bring to a boil.
Submerge the corn and corn tortillas in the soup.
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Stir to break up the tortillas before serving. Top with avocado, cilantro, and cotija cheese if you want!
Enjoy!
