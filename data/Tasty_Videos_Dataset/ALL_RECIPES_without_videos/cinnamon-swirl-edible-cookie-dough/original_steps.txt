Soak cashews in boiling water for two hours.
Drain the cashews and blend in a food processor for 30 seconds. Pour in coconut oil and 3 tablespoons of agave and blend for 1 minute.
Scrape down sides and add in almond flour. Blend until smooth, approximately 2-5 minutes.
Remove the mixture from the food processor and transfer to a food storage container.
In a small bowl, mix cinnamon and remaining agave until cinnamon is fully incorporated.
Pour cinnamon mixture over dough and swirl around with a toothpick, knife, or skewer, then lightly stir with a spatula to distribute the cinnamon swirl.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
Enjoy!
