Peel bananas and cut in half. Place popsicle sticks inside bananas and put on tray with parchment paper.
Freeze for 1 to 3 hours depending on how firm you want your bananas to be.
Combine almonds and coconut into a bowl.
Heat semi-sweet chocolate chips in microwave at 30 second intervals until liquified.
Coat bananas in chocolate and sprinkle with the almond and coconut mixture. Chocolate will harden so move quickly! Serve immediately or set aside and freeze for an additional 10 minutes.
Enjoy!
