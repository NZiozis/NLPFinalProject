Preheat oven 350˚F (180˚F).
In a bowl, add the milk, egg, honey, pumpkin puree, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla until combined.
Stir in the oats and chocolate chips.
Transfer the oat mixture to 15 silicone muffin cups, or a muffin tin lined with cupcake liners.
Bake for 30 minutes, until light golden on top.
Store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
Enjoy!
