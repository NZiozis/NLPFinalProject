Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Slice the baguette into 1-inch (3cm) chunks, then transfer to a 9x13 (23 x 33cm) baking dish.
Toss the bread in half of the marinara, then sprinkle with half of the mozzarella on top.
Nestle the meatballs into the bread mixture evenly, then cover with the remaining marinara and mozzarella.
Sprinkle ¾ of the parmesan on top, saving the rest for garnish.
Bake for 20 minutes until the cheese has melted and is starting to brown.
Serve with the remaining parmesan and basil.
Enjoy!
