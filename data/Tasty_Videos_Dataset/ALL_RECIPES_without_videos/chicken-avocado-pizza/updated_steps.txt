In a small/medium jar, mix olive oil, minced garlic, salt, black pepper, oregano, and chili flakes together.
Shake it well, and save it in refrigerator for later.
NOTE: Refrigerate left over garlic sauce.
It lasts for up to one week
Pre-heat the oven at 425ºF (220ºC).
Oil spray the flat baking pan, roll out the pre-made pizza crust, if it’s needed, use a rolling pan to make the crust equally flat on the pan.
Spread garlic sauce on pizza crust, place down sliced fresh mozzarella, sliced chicken breasts (cooked) and sprinkle diced onions.
Bake it in the oven for 25-30 minutes until the cheese melts and the crust become golden brown.
Take the pizza out and place down sliced avocados, and some grape tomatoes.
Enjoy!
