For the guacamole: Mash avocados with the lime juice. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly.
For the queso: In a pot over medium heat, melt 1 Tbsp. butter and sauté scallions. Add cheese, milk and cornstarch, and mix until melted and smooth. Add green chiles and mix until combined.
Serving: Draw eyes and carve a sad mouth on a small pumpkin. Hollow out the inside and insert a bowl. Pour queso in the bowl and top with chopped tomatoes. Spoon guacamole coming out of the pumpkin’s mouth. Serve with chips!
