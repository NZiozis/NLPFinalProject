Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with cooking spray.
Make the cookie base: Chop the candy into bite-size pieces, then transfer to a medium bowl and set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and granulated sugar.
Add the butter and cream with an electric hand mixer until fluffy.
Add the egg, vanilla, salt, and baking soda and mix with a rubber spatula to combine.
Fold in the flour just until smooth, then add the candy pieces and fold to incorporate.
Transfer the dough to the prepared springform pan and pat down in an even layer.
Refrigerate until ready to use.
Make the cheesecake filling: In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and sugar.
Beat with an electric hand mixer until smooth.
Add the salt, vanilla, and eggs and beat to combine.
Pour the filling over the chilled base and smooth the top.
Bake 35-40 minutes, until the sides are golden but the center still jiggles slightly.
Let cool to room temperature.
Drizzle chocolate syrup in a spiral pattern over the cheesecake.
Using a toothpick, draw lines outward from the center to create a spiderweb pattern.
Un-mold the cheesecake, then slice and serve.
Enjoy!
