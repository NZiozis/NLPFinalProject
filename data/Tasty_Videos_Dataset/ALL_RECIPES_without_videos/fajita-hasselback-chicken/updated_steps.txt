Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Slice into the chicken several times, about ½ cm (¼ inch) apart, but only cut about 85% of the way through, leaving the bottom intact.
Cook the onions and peppers over a medium heat until softened, then stir in the fajita mix.
Stir in the salsa and sprinkle the cheese over.
Mix together until the cheese has melted.
Allow to cool to the touch, and then fill each segment of the chicken breast with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture.
Bake in the centre of the oven for 18-22 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear.
Enjoy!
