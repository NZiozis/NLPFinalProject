Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
In a medium heat-proof bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric hand mixer until combined.
Add the water to a small pot over low heat and rest the bowl on top. Constantly beat the egg mixture on low speed until it reaches 160˚F (71˚C). Remove the bowl from the heat and stir as it cools.
Lay a prepared pie crust in a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish. Lay a sheet of parchment paper over crust and place 4 spoons or dried beans in the center, weighing down the crust.
Bake for 15 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool.
Add the peppermint extract and melted chocolate to the egg mixture. Stir until combined.
Gradually beat in the butter until well combined.
Gradually fold in the whipped cream until just incorporated.
Carefully spoon the filling into the prepared pie crust and chill for at least 2 hours.
Garnish with whipped cream, shaved chocolate, and crushed peppermint candies.
Enjoy!
