Preheat oven to 425ºF (220ºC).
Lay the corn tortillas on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and lightly brush both sides with olive oil.
Bake the tortillas for 5 minutes and then flip them over continue baking another 5 minutes.
The tostadas should be brown and crispy.
Set the pan aside to cool.
Roughly chop the shrimp and transfer to a bowl.
Add the cucumber, tomato, avocado, red onion, lemon juice, lime juice, cilantro, salt, and serrano chile (optional), and stir to combine.
Marinate for 10-15 minutes.
Spoon the shrimp mixture onto the tostadas.
Enjoy!
