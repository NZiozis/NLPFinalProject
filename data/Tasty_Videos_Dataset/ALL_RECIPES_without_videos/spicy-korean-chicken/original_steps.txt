Mix the ingredients for the batter in a bowl until smooth with no lumps.
Heat oil in a pot to 340°F (170°C).
Dip a chicken wing into the cornstarch, shaking off excess, then dredge the wing into the batter, dripping off excess.
Fry half of the wings at a time for about 5-7 minutes, until light golden. The oil will drop to about 320°F (160°C).
Drain the wings and increase the heat. Heat oil to about 375°F (190°C).
Fry the wings a second time until golden brown and crispy. Drain and set aside.
In a pan, combine all the ingredients for the sauce and stir until bubbling. Toss in the wings.
Enjoy!
