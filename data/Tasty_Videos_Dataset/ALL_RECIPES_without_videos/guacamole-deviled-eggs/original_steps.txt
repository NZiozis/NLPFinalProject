Place the eggs in a pot and fill with cold water until the eggs are just covered. Bring the pot to a boil, then cover, remove from heat, and let sit for about 12 minutes.
Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water for about 3 minutes, then peel them and cut them in half. Transfer the egg yolks to a bowl, and set the cooked egg whites aside.
Mix the avocado, cilantro, jalape√±o, red onion, tomato, garlic, cumin, lime juice, and salt with the yolks and transfer to a piping bag. (Alternatively, use a zip-top bag with a corner cut off.)
Pipe the mixture into the eggs, garnish with cilantro and crushed tortilla chips, and serve chilled.
Enjoy!
