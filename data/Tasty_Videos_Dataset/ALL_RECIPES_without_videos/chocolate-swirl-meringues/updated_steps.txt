Preheat the oven to 100°C (210°F).
In a bowl, separate the egg whites and whisk until soft peaks form.
Gradually add the sugar in stages, as you whisk.
Whisk in the vanilla extract and white wine vinegar.
Keep whisking until stiff peaks form, or until you can tip the bowl upside down and the meringue holds its shape.
Gently fold in the melted chocolate, taking care not to overmix.
Spoon the meringue onto a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper.
Bake for 60 minutes, until the meringue no longer sticks to the paper.
Serve with raspberries and strawberries.
Enjoy!
