Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
Make parallel cuts in each chicken breast without slicing all of the way through. Place chicken breasts in a large bowl.
Add buttermilk and ranch seasoning mix to the bowl and stir until chicken is well-coated. Marinate in refrigerator for 4 hours, or overnight.
While chicken is marinating, place cheese puffs in a food processor or blender and pulse until finely ground. Pour into a large bowl.
Using tongs or yours hands, toss each marinated chicken breast into cheese puff powder.
Bend coated chicken breast to form a hollow circle. Use a toothpick to seal the ends together.
Heat oil to 350째F (175째C) in a large skillet or pot.
Carefully place each breast in the hot oil and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until internal temperature of chicken breast reaches 165째F (75째C).
Remove the chicken breasts and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Serve with french fries, carrots, broccoli, and ranch dressing, if desired.
Enjoy!
