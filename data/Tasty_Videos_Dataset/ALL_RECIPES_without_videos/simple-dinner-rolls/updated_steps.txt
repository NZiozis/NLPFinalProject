Combine water, olive oil, honey, salt, flour, yeast, and water in a large bowl.
Mix well and knead for 10-15 minutes until the dough is elastic.
Transfer the dough into a well-oiled bowl.
Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise once for 1 hour in a warm place, until the dough has doubled.
Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Cut the dough into 8 portions and shape into balls.
Place balls onto greased cast-iron pan and cover for 30 additional minutes with a towel or plastic wrap.
Uncover and brush each with egg wash.
Bake or 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.
Enjoy!
