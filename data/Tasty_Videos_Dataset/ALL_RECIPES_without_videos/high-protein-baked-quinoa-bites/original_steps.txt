Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Finely chop the Tuscan kale. Mince the garlic.
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Sauté the minced garlic and red pepper flakes for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the kale and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Chop the sun-dried tomatoes and add to the kale mixture.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs, then add the quinoa, oat flour, kale mixture, oregano, basil, parsley, salt, and Parmesan cheese. Mix well.
Shape the quinoa mixture into 20 small patties. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, until the patties are golden brown and crispy.
Serve as desired. The bites will keep in the fridge for up to 6 days, or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
Enjoy!
