Chop the head of cauliflower into florets.
Bring a medium pot of water to boil over medium-high heat.
Add a pinch of salt and the cauliflower and boil for 15 minutes, or until the cauliflower is soft.
Drain the cauliflower, then return to the pot.
Add the butter, salt, and milk to the cauliflower.
Mash the ingredients together until most of the milk is absorbed and the texture is creamy.
Add pepper and the cheddar cheese and stir to combine.
Add the chives and mix.
Garnish with chives and more cheddar cheese.
Enjoy!
