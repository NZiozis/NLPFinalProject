Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over high heat.
Add the steak, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned, 5-6 minutes.
Remove from the pan.
Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then add the red onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until softened and browned.
Add the tomato, garlic, and aji amarillo paste, and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes have released some of their juices, but are still intact.
Add the soy sauce and vinegar and stir to combine, let cook for 1 minute.
Add the steak, fries, and cilantro.
Toss gently to coat the fries in the sauce.
Serve with rice, if desired.
Enjoy!
