Preheat the oven to 325˚F (170˚C).
Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and melt completely, about 1 minute.
Separate the egg yolks and egg whites. Using a hand mixer, whisk the whites until soft peaks form.
Add the yolks, one by one, into the bowl of chocolate, whisking to combine.
Using a rubber spatula, gently fold ⅓ of the whipped egg whites into the yolk and chocolate mixture. Repeat with the remaining egg whites, adding ⅓ at a time.
Pour the batter in a greased 6-inch (15 cm) cake mold.
Bake for 30 minutes.
Once the cake is cool to the touch, gently invert it onto a plate.
Optional: Sprinkle with powdered sugar, slice and serve top with ice cream. Serve with seasonal fruit.
Enjoy!
