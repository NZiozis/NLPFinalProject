Cut zucchini in half and hollow out the centers
Add the Greek yogurt, lime juice, and salt together in a small bowl and stir to combine.
On a cutting board, season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and chili powder.
Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken and cook until browned, about 3 minutes.
Remove the chicken from the pan and let cool.
Once cooled, shred the chicken with a fork.
Add the chicken to a bowl with the salsa and stir to combine.
Stuff chicken mixture in hollowed out zucchini boats, and top with cheddar cheese.
