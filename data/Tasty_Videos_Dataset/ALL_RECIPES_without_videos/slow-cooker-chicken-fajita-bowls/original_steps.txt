Lay on the chicken, and coat both sides with taco seasoning, salt, and pepper.
Sprinkle on garlic, half of the lime juice, and diced tomatoes. Cover with remaining peppers, onion, and lime juice.
Cover and cook on high for 3 hours.
Remove chicken from the slow cooker, shred, and return to slow cooker.
Cover until heated through.
