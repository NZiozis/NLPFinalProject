Using a serrated knife, cut the pint of ice cream crosswise into 3 equal discs.
Lay out 3 chocolate chip cookies and place a pint slice on top of each. Remove the ice cream packaging.
Freeze for 30 minutes.
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and coconut oil, and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until the chocolate is silky smooth. Let the chocolate cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes.
Remove the ice cream and cookies from the freezer and use a spoon to drizzle chocolate on the top and off the sides of each ice cream slice.
Top with the remaining 3 chocolate chip cookie and freeze for 30 minutes more before serving.
Enjoy!
