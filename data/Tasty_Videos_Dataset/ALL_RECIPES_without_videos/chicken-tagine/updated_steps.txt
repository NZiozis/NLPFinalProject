Place seasoned chicken thighs skin-side down and cook until the skin is brown and crispy, about 4–5 minutes.
Then flip the thighs over and brown the other side for 4 minutes.
Remove chicken from the pan.
In a large bowl, add baby potatoes, cherry tomatoes, shallots, and apricots.
Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Mix until evenly coated.
Place the vegetables into the bottom of the tagine and arrange the chicken, skin-side up, around the top, wedging a slice of lemon between each piece of chicken.
Place the lid on the tagine and place in the oven for 1 hour and 40 minutes, or until chicken is 165ºF (75ºC) and falls off the bone.
Garnish with fresh parsley and toasted almond slivers.
ENJOY!
