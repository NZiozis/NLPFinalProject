Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Pour gravy into an ice cube tray and freeze until the cubes are solid and can be removed easily.
Place the potatoes into a pot with cold, salted water and bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender.
Drain the potatoes until completely dry.
While still hot, mash the potatoes with a potato masher, fork, potato ricer, or food mill. If the potatoes get too cold, reheat them in the oven or microwave until hot and dry again.
To the mashed potatoes, add the sour cream, butter, egg yolks, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Fold the mixture together with a spatula until just incorporated, making sure not to overmix.
Transfer the mixture to a piping bag or a zip-top bag with a star tip.
Pipe a disc of the mashed potatoes on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray.
Place an ice cube of frozen gravy in the center, and pipe more mashed potatoes around the gravy cube,
Freeze until the potatoes are firm.
Brush with egg wash until completely coated.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are heated all the way through and golden brown.
Serve while still hot.
Enjoy!
