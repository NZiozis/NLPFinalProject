Peel the avocado, then slice very thinly crosswise.
Starting from one end, fan out the sliced avocado in straight line, then curl into a ring shape.
Spread the mayonnaise over the slice of toast.
Top with the radish slices.
Carefully transfer the avocado ring to the toast and decorate with edible flowers
Enjoy!
