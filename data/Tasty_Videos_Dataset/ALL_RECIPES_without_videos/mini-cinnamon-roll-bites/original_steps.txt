Roll out the pie crust and cut to a rectangle shape.
Cover with your desired amount of melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon.
Roll the crust up.
Cut into little discs. Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 10-15 minutes, depending on how thick you cut them.
In a bowl, mix powdered sugar with milk until it becomes a glaze. Add milk if you want a thinner consistency.
Enjoy!
