Sear the chicken until golden brown in the pan with the salt and pepper. Take out and set aside.
In the same pan, fry the garlic and red pepper for a couple of minutes before stirring in the soy sauce, ketchup, and vinegar.
Add the chicken and noodles, and mix together for another couple of minutes.
Garnish with sesame seeds.
Enjoy!
