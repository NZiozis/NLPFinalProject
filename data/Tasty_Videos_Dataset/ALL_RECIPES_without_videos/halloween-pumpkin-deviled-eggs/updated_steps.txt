Peel and slice hard boiled eggs lengthwise.
Separate yolks into a separate bowl.
Add mustard, mayonnaise, paprika, salt, and pepper to the yolks, and mix thoroughly.
Fill a piping bag with the yolk mixture, and pipe into the empty egg whites.
Sprinkle with paprika, and place a piece of chive to make it look like a pumpkin.
Enjoy!
