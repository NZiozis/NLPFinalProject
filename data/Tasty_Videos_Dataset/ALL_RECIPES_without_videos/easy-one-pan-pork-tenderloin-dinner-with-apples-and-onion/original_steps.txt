Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Pat dry the pork tenderloin and generously season with salt and pepper on all sides.
Heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, until oil is shimmering and just starting to smoke.
Place pork in the hot skillet and leave to sear until nice and browned on one side, about 1 ½ - 2 minutes. Flip and repeat, to sear on all sides.
Remove the pork from the skillet, and set aside.
Add 1 additional tablespoon of oil to skillet, or as needed.
Add sliced onion to hot skillet. Toss to coat. Add garlic and apples, and continue to cook until apples and onion begin to soften.
Pour cider over apples and onion, bring to a simmer.
Place pork back in the skillet, on top of apple and onion mixture. Spoon cooking liquid over the pork and transfer the entire skillet to a preheated oven.
Bake for 15-20 minutes until pork is cooked through. (Internal temperature reaches 145˚F (62˚C.)
Remove skillet from the oven, allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve sliced pork over a bed of the apples and onions.
Enjoy!
