Cover a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Set aside.
Mix the sugar, syrup, and honey together in a saucepan.
Turn up the heat and slide a thermometer into the mixture. Heat till the sugar mixture reaches 275°F (140°C) and is brown and bubbling.
Take the thermometer out and quickly whisk in the bicarbonate of soda.
Pour the honeycomb into the prepared tray and leave to set. Do not touch the honeycomb at all throughout.
Once set, smash up the honeycomb into bite-size pieces.
Dip into the melted chocolate and chill.
Enjoy!
