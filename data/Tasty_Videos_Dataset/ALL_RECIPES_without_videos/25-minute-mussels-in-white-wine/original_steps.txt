To clean mussels, scrub them with a stiff brush under cold running water to remove any grit. Discard any mussels with cracked or broken shells, or that do not close.
In a large lidded pot over medium-high heat, stir butter until melted. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until it has softened and started to brown, 6-8 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
Add the red pepper flakes and season with salt. Stir to combine.
Add the mussels and stir until completely coated. Add the white wine and stir.
Put the lid on the pot and cook until the mussels have opened, 3-5 minutes. Discard any shells that donâ€™t open after 5 minutes.
Add the parsley and stir. Serve with bread.
Enjoy!
