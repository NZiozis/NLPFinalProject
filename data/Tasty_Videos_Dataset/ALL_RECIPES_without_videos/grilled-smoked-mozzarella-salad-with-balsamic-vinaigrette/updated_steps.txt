Combine Dijon mustard, honey, salt, pepper, oil, and balsamic vinaigrette in a small bowl and stir to combine.
NOTE: You can also shake the ingredients in a jar with a secure lid.
Slice the mozzarella into Â¼-inch (6 mm) slices and toss them with olive oil in a bowl.
Press each slice into the breadcrumbs to fully coat the entire surface.
Lay the slices out on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and freeze for about 30 to 45 minutes.
Cook each slice in a pan or grill about 2 minutes each side until breadcrumbs are golden and grill marks appear.
Transfer each slice onto your salad and top with salad dressing.
Enjoy!
