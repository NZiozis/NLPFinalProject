Slice apple into quarters, slicing around the core.
Carefully carve a slice out of one of the quarters, careful not to slice all the way through and separate the apple.
This creates the “mouth.”
Remove the center slice and spread the bottom half with nut butter.
Press the sunflowers into the top side of the “mouth” to create the “teeth.”
Enjoy!
