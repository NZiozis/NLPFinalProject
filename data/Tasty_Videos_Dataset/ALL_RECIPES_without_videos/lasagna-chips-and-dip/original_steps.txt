Cook the noodles according to package directions, omitting salt. Drain well and separate the noodles carefully.
Cut the noodles into triangles and transfer to baking sheet.
In a small bowl, combine the water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Brush on both sides of noodles.
Combine 2 teaspoons of salt, the dried oregano, dried basil, paprika, and garlic powder in a small bowl, and mix to combine.
Sprinkle the seasoning mixture and ⅓ cup (35 g) of Parmesan cheese over the noodles. Set aside.
Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the minced onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 5-10 minutes.
Once the vegetables have caramelized, add the ground beef, Italian sausage, ½ teaspoon of salt, ¼ teaspoon of pepper, and the tomato paste. Stir to combine, breaking up the meat.
Cook until the meat has browned, 15-20 minutes.
Add the red wine. Bring the sauce to a simmer, cover with a lid, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, then set aside.
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta, spinach, fresh basil, remaining cup of Parmesan cheese, remaining teaspoon of salt, and remaining ½ teaspoon of pepper.
Spread half of the meat sauce in the bottom of an ovenproof dish.
Gently spread the ricotta cheese over the sauce.
Spoon the remaining meat sauce over the ricotta and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
Bake the noodles and layered dip for 12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the noodle chips are crispy.
Sprinkle more Parmesan cheese on top of noodle chips, if desired.
Sprinkle parsley on top of dip, if desired.
Enjoy!
