Throw all of the ‘base’ ingredients into a blender and whizz until smooth.
NOTE: You can adapt this entire recipe as much or as little as you like, we chose to make one that looks super green with a somewhat neutral taste to let the toppings bring out the flavor.
Pour the smoothie into a bowl, and top with your favorite toppings.
Our suggested toppings are just that too, suggestions - be as creative as you like here - pecans, flax seeds, sliced peaches - whatever you like.
Make a cool design too!
Enjoy!
