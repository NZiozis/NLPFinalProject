Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Toss in the shrimp and immediately season with the taco seasoning. Sauté the shrimp just until each piece has started to turn pink, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, combine the lettuce, shrimp, tomatoes, jalpeño, red onion, cilantro, avocado, salt, and lime juice, and mix until the salad is well-combined.
Serve with tortilla strips, if desired.
Enjoy!
