In a large bowl, prepare marinade - mix soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, Sriracha, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, and the ribs.
Marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 275˚F (190˚C).
Bake ribs on a baking sheet for 30 minutes.
Make the sticky sauce in a saucepan by combining soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and honey. Bring to a low boil, reduce heat, and simmer until sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.
Heat oil for frying to 350˚F (180˚C).
Place ribs into the oil a few at a time and fry for 4 minutes, flipping them occasionally. Drain on a paper towel.
Toss fried ribs in the sticky sauce and garnish with toasted sesame seeds and green onions.
Enjoy!
