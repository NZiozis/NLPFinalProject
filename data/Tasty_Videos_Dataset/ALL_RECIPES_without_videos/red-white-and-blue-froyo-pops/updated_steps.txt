Fill popsicle mold or muffin tin with a thick layer of Greek yogurt.
Add in strawberries and blueberries.
You can either layer them or mix them around to distribute the fruit throughout.
Cover with top layer of Greek yogurt and use a spatula or a spoon to flatten the surface.
Place popsicle sticks in the center of the molds or muffin tin and place in the freezer for 2 hours or until frozen to your liking.
If using a muffin tin, you might want to let the froyo freeze before placing in popsicle sticks so that they donâ€™t fall over.
Remove from popsicle molds or muffin tin.
Enjoy!
