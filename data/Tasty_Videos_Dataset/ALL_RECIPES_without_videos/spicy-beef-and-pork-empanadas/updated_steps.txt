Fry onion and garlic for a few minutes, then add the ground pork and the ground beef, seasoned with salt and pepper.
Continue stirring and browning the meat until cooked through, about 3-5 minutes.
Add all the fruit, raisins, almonds, and pine nuts, stir to combine, then remove from heat and chill.
Poach the poblano pepper, remove the skin.
Open and remove the seeds and veins, then cut into strips.
Set aside.
Preheat oven to 500˚F (250˚C) (or as high as your oven will go).
For the empanada dough, mix flour, butter, salt and milk, kneading into a dough.
Add egg, then knead until firm.
Pinch off a bit of dough and flatten into a circle, adding two strips of chile poblano and the meat filling.
Put a bit of water on your finger and wet the edge of half the empanada.
Close the empanada and use a fork to seal the edges.
Brush with an egg wash before putting on a baking sheet.
Bake 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
Top the empanadas with cashew cream and garnish with pomegranate and cilantro.
Enjoy!
