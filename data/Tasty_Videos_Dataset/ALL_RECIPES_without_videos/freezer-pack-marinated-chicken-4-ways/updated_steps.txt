Combine all marinade ingredients in a liquid measuring cup.
Place two chicken breasts in a freezer storage ziplock bag.
Pour the marinade over the chicken, seal the bag and massage the chicken to coat in the marinade.
Marinate the chicken for 15-30 minutes if cooking immediately, or place in the freezer for up to 3 months.
To cook frozen chicken, take the bag out of the freezer and thaw the chicken by placing it in the refrigerator overnight or by placing the bag in a bowl of water.
Preheat oven to 350째F (180째C).
Once thawed, place chicken on a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165째F (75째C)
Enjoy!
