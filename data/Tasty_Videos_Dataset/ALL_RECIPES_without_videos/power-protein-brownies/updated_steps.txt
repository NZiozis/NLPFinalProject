Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Grease and line a 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish with parchment paper.
In a food processor, combine the bananas, black beans, cocoa powder, almond butter, almond flour, salt, baking powder, and vanilla.
Pulse until smooth.
Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.
Sprinkle the dark chocolate chips over the top.
Bake for 25 minutes, or until the brownies are set.
Let cool, then slice into 12 pieces.
Enjoy the brownies immediately, or store in the fridge for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
Enjoy
