Make the dough: in a large bowl, combine the warm milk, melted butter, and granulated sugar.
Add the yeast, baking powder, salt, and 2 cups (250 g) of flour. Stir to combine.
Add 2 more cups (250 g) of flour and stir until the dough comes together.
Flour a clean surface with the remaining cup of flour. Coat your hands with flour. Dump the dough out onto the floured surface and knead until smooth, about 10 minutes.
Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 2 hours in a warm area until it’s doubled in size.
Make the filling: in a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract until smooth.
In a medium bowl, combine the raspberry jam with one tablespoon of the cream cheese filling.
In a small bowl, combine the blueberry jam with one teaspoon of the cream cheese filling.
Once the dough has risen, lightly flour a clean surface and roll the dough out to a 10x15-inch (25x38-cm) rectangle, about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
Brush about 5 inches (13 cm) of the roll with the cream cheese filling, about 8 inches (20 cm) of the roll with the raspberry filling, and about 1½ inches (3 cm) with the blueberry filling. Set aside the leftover cream cheese filling.
Starting from the bottom, roll up the dough and cut into 9 equal pieces.
Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) square baking dish with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper.
Place the rolls in the pan, with the blueberry roll and 2 raspberry rolls in the top row, 3 cream cheese rolls in the middle row, and 3 raspberry rolls in the bottom row, to look like an American flag.
Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let rise for 1 hour in a warm area, until doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Bake the rolls for 25 minutes, or until golden brown on top.
Remove the rolls from the baking dish.
Microwave the reserved cream cheese filling for about 30 seconds, until pourable. Drizzle on top of the rolls.
Enjoy!
