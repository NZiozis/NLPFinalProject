Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Cover a sheet pan with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
Spread out your potatoes on the pan and drizzle with 1 Tbsp.
olive oil and 1 Tbsp.
lemon juice.
Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle ½ Tbsp.
thyme, and 1 clove minced garlic over the potatoes.
Bake for 15 minutes, flip, then bake for another 10 minutes.
In the meantime, create your salmon glaze.
Combine 2 Tbsp.
lemon juice, 2 Tbsp.
honey, 2 tsp ginger, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1 Tbsp.
thyme.
Set aside.
Take the potatoes out of the oven and push them to the top or side of your pan.
(Don’t cramp them — Make sure to still space them out a bit.)
Place your salmon fillets on the pan.
Season both sides with salt and pepper and brush on the glaze onto both sides, then top with lemon slices and sprigs of thyme.
Place your asparagus on the pan and top with 1 Tbsp.
olive oil, 1 Tbsp.
lemon juice, salt and pepper, 1 clove minced garlic, and ½ Tbsp.
of thyme.
Bake for 8-10 minutes.
(The salmon should flake easily with a fork when it’s ready.)
Enjoy!
