Preheat oven to 400°F/200˚C.
In a bowl, mix the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt, and lemon zest.
Set aside.
On parchment paper, stack 2 pie crusts on top of each other.
Roll out to 17 inches by 12 inches (43 cm by 30 cm).
Cut diagonally into strips.
Roll out another 2 pie crusts.
Place in a 15x10x1 inch (38x25x2.5 cm) baking sheet.
Spread out blueberry mixture into the crust, then form a lattice top with the pie crust strips.
Tuck the crust inward around the edges, and bake for 35 minutes.
Serve warm with ice cream.
Enjoy!
