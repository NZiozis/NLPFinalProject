Use a vegetable peeler to peel the cucumbers.
On a cutting board, cut and discard the ends. Then cut the cucumbers in half. Scoop out the seeds and discard.
In a small mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, red onion, and dill, and mix until well incorporated.
Spread the cream cheese mixture on both sides of the prepared cucumber, top with smoked salmon, and close the sandwich.
Enjoy!
