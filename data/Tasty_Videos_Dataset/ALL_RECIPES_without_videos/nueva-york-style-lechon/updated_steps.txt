Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Combine the minced garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.
Rub the mixture on the inside cavity of the suckling pig.
Stuff the lemongrass, onion, green onions, and longanisa inside the cavity.
Sew the cavity shut with butcher’s twine.
Transfer the pig to a large baking sheet.
Brush the pig with soy sauce and cover the ears and tail with aluminum foil.
Roast for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350˚F (180˚C) and continue to cook for 2½ hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160˚F (70˚C) and the skin is crispy.
Remove the pig from the oven and reserve the pan drippings for the pancit.
Enjoy!
