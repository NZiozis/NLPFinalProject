Preheat the oven to 180˚C (350˚F).
In a bowl, whisk together the butter and sugar until combined.
Whisk in the egg, oil, and vanilla extract.
Mix in the baking powder and 250 grams (2 cups) of the flour with a spoon until combined.
Bring the mixture together using your hands to make a dough.
Spray a 23 centimeter (9 inch) square baking tray with cooking oil.
Spread out half of the dough on the tray.
Prick the dough with a fork to prevent bubbles from forming while baking.
Spread the blackcurrant jam on top.
With the remaining dough, mix in the remaining flour and rub with your fingers to make a crumb like texture.
Sprinkle the crumbs on top of the jam.
Bake for 20 minutes, until golden brown on top.
Leave to cool for around 20 minutes, the jam will be hot!
