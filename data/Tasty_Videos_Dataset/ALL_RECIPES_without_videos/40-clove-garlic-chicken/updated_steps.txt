Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (350°F)
Season the chicken with the salt, pepper and mixed herbs.
Set aside.
Heat some oil in a large pan and sear the chicken for about 10-15 minutes evenly on each side, until golden brown.
Take the chicken out and set aside.
Add the shallots and cook down in the remaining juices for about 5 minutes over a low-medium heat.
Add the garlic cloves and gently cook them for about 2 minutes.
Pour in the vermouth or white wine and gently cook so that it reduces slightly.
Add the chicken, parsley sprigs and tarragon, followed by the chicken stock.
Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
Serve with crusty bread and vegetables of your choice.
Enjoy!
