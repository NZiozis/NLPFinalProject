Add the potatoes to a large pot and cover with cold water.
Add the salt.
Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes longer.
Drain and return to the pot.
Set aside.
In a small pot over medium heat, bring the butter, cream, and garlic to a simmer.
Once simmering, remove from the heat.
Pour the cream mixture over the potatoes.
Add the sour cream, then mash with a hand masher until the potatoes are creamy, but still very chunky.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Garnish with green onions, if desired.
Note: Any small waxy potato would work well in this recipe â€” such as Yukon Golds or new potatoes.
Enjoy!
