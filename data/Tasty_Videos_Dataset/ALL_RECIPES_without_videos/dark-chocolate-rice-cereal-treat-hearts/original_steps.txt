Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the marshmallows and stir constantly until smooth and melted. Add the rice cereal and stir until well coated.
Transfer the mixture to a buttered 8-inch (20 cm) square baking pan and press into an even layer. Set aside to cool, about 1 hour.
Once the rice cereal treats have cooled, use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut out shapes from the treats.
In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the dark chocolate in 30-second intervals, stirring between, until melted and smooth.
Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Dip half of each heart in the melted chocolate, then set on the baking sheet. Immediately, while the chocolate is still is warm, sprinkle the chocolate side with red sanding sugar and Valentineâ€™s sprinkles. Let cool until the chocolate hardens completely, 1-2 hours.
Enjoy!
