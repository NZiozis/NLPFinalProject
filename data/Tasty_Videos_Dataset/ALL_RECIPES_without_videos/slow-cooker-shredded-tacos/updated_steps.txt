In your slow cooker, mix the salsa, lime juice, taco seasoning, and cilantro.
Salt and pepper the chicken to taste, then mix into the sauce.
Cover and cook on high for four hours or low for seven to eight hours.
Remove the chicken, shred with two forks, and return to the slow cooker and stir.
Freeze leftovers in an airtight bag for up to six months!
Enjoy!
