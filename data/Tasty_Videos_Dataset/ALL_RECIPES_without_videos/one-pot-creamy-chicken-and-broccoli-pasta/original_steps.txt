Heat half of the oil in a large pot. Add in the chicken, season with half of the seasoned salt and pepper, and cook.
Once the chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, remove it from the pan. Set aside.
Add in remaining oil, onion, and broccoli. Cover for 2 minutes. Season with remaining seasoned salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the onions begin to become translucent.
Pour in milk and bring to a boil. Stir periodically so the bottom does not burn.
Once milk is bubbling, add pasta and stir frequently until pasta reaches your desired doneness (approximately 10 minutes at medium heat).
Add in Parmesan and mozzarella. Stir until cheese is melted.
Stir in chicken until well incorporated.
Enjoy!
