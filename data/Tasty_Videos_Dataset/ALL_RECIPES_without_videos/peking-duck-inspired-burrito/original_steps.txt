Place duck breast in pan to marinate.
Rub oil, salt, garlic, soy sauce, rice wine, and five-spice powder into the duck breasts. Let it marinate for 30 minutes.
Add one Tbsp. of oil to a hot skillet over medium heat. Add the duck breasts skin side down, cook until the skin is browned and crispy (can take up to 8-10 minutes, depending on your heat).
Flip the duck so skin side is up. Place the skillet under the broiler for five minutes to further crisp the skin. Be careful not to burn the skin.
Remove from oven and let it rest for five minutes before slicing.
Spread hoisin sauce over the flour tortilla, layer on the rice, duck slices, cucumbers, and scallions.
Wrap it all up.
Enjoy!
