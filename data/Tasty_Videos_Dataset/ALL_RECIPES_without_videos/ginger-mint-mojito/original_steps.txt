In a medium bowl, combine the lime rinds and sugar. Toss to coat the rinds with the sugar, then cover. Let sit, stirring every 45 minutes, for about 4 hours, or until the sugar is completely dissolved and thereâ€™s syrup in the bottom of the bowl.
Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, pushing to extract as much liquid as possible. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.
In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine the rum, lime juice, simple syrup, and mint leaves. Shake vigorously for 20 seconds.
Strain into a glass filled with ice and top with ginger beer.
Garnish with the slice of lime and mint leaves.
Enjoy!
