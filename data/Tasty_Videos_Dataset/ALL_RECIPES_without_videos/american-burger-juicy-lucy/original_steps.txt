Mix together the patty ingredients until evenly combined.
Flatten the beef into a thin layer, then place a chunk of cheddar inside, wrapping the beef completely around the cheddar. Form a patty with your hands.
Repeat with the remaining beef and cheese.
Heat oil in a pan over medium heat.
Cook the burgers for 3 minutes on the first side, flip, then cook for 6 more minutes.
Assemble the burgers with the bun, bacon, tomato, and lettuce.
Enjoy!
