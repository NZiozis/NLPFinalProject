Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the tahini, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, maple syrup, garlic, water, salt, and pepper.
Reserve half of the sauce for serving and add the tofu to the bowl with the remaining sauce.
Toss to coat.
Marinate for 15 minutes.
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small pot over medium heat.
Cook the tofu until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side.
Remove the tofu from the pan, then slice.
Add the quinoa and vegetable stock to the same pot.
Stir the quinoa and bring to a boil over high heat.
Then, reduce the heat to low and place a strainer over the simmering quinoa.
Add the cherry tomatoes, carrot, yellow pepper, snap peas, red onion, and purple cabbage to the strainer.
Sprinkle with salt.
Cover and cook for 20 minutes, until the quinoa is cooked and the veggies are tender.
Remove the pot from the heat, fluff the quinoa and divide into 2 bowls, then add the veggies and tofu.
Pour the reserved sauce over.
Enjoy!
