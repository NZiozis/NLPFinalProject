Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Butter each side of the tortillas, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and cut into even quarters, making 12 pieces.
Place two pieces in each cup of a muffin tin and push down so that it creates a cup shape.
Bake for 13-15 minutes or until crisp.
In a bowl, mix together heavy cream, vanilla extract, and sugar.
Assemble the cups by placing a spoonful of whipped cream in the toasted cup.
Top with fresh fruits of your choice.
Enjoy!
