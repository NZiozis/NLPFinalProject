In a large bowl, toss the strawberries and rhubarb with the sugar, salt, and cornstarch. Set to the side.
Line a pie tin with the pie dough.
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Empty rhubarb and strawberry mixture into the pie tin, evenly distributing the mixture.
Cut pie dough into strips and weave a lattice design on top of the pie. (You can also top with more pie dough in a full sheet with slits.)
Bake the pie until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 2 hours. Cover the edge of the pie with foil if it begins to darken.
Let cool slightly before serving.
Enjoy!
