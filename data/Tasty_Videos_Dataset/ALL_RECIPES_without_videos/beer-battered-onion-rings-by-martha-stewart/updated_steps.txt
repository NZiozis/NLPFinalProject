In a large pot over medium-high heat, bring 3 inches (8 cm) of oil to 375˚F (190˚C).
Peel and cut onions crosswise into ½ (1 ⅓ cm) inch slices.
Separate into rings and place in a large bowl with ice water while you prepare the batter.
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour (125 g), salt, white pepper, and baking powder.
Whisk in beer and 2 tablespoons of ice water until just combined.
In a separate bowl, add the remaining 1 cup (125 g) of flour.
Remove the rings from the ice water bath and pat dry.
Coat the rings first in the flour then in the batter, allowing any excess to drip off.
Working in batches, transfer battered rings to hot oil to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown.
Transfer to a paper towel lined rack to drain.
Sprinkle with salt.
Enjoy!
