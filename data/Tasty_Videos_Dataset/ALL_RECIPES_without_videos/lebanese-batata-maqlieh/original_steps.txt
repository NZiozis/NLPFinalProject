Make the garlic sauce: Add the garlic and salt to a food processor and process until completely smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
With the processor running, slowly pour in Â½ cup (120 ml) of olive oil and continue to process until smooth and creamy. The mixture should begin to thicken as the oil emulsifies with the garlic.
Pour in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, while continuing to process, so that the lemon juice incorporates completely and the mixture does not separate.
Add the remaining olive oil and 2 tablespoons lemon juice and process until very smooth. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl.
Serve the fries with the garlic sauce and sprinkle with parsley.
Enjoy!
