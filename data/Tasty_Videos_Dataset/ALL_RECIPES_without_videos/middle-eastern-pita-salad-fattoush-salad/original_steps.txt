Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Slice the pitas in half to make 4 thin rounds. Place the pitas on a nonstick sheet pan. Brush with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt.
Bake for about 5 minutes, until the outside is golden brown. Let cool until they become crispy.
Make 3 cuts lengthwise on each of the romaine hearts, remove the stems, and chop into smaller pieces. Rinse, drain, and add to a large salad bowl.
Seed the cucumber, dice it, and add it to the salad bowl.
Cut the tomatoes in half and add them to the salad bowl.
Mince the scallions and add them to the salad bowl.
Add the radishes, bell pepper, parsley, and mint to the salad bowl and toss to combine.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the remaining ½ cup (120 ml) of oil, the lemon juice, white wine vinegar, garlic, sumac, allspice, salt, and pepper and whisk until well-combined.
Pour the dressing over the salad.
Break the crispy pitas into small pieces and add to the salad. Toss well.
Enjoy!
