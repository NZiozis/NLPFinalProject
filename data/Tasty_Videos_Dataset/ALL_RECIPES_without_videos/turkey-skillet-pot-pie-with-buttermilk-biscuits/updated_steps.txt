Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a 10-inch (25 cm) cast iron skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
Add the ¼ cup (30 g) of flour, and cook, stirring constantly, until smooth.
Add the chicken stock and salt to taste.
Cook until the stock has reduced and thickened.
Add in the rosemary, frozen vegetables, turkey, and additional salt, and stir until fully mixed.
Remove from the heat.
Add remaining flour, baking soda, 8 tablespoons of butter, and pinch of salt to a bowl.
Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix together until the butter is the size of peas.
Add the buttermilk and mix until the dough barely comes together, about 1 minute.
Place the dough on a floured countertop and gently form into a 1½-inch (4 cm) thick layer.
Use a 3-inch (6 cm) round cutter to cut 10-12 biscuits, rerolling the dough as needed.
Place the biscuits on the turkey in the cast iron skillet.
Brush the top of the biscuits with heavy cream (optional).
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until biscuits are golden brown.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
