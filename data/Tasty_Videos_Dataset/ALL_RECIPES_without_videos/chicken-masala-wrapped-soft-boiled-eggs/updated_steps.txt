Boil 5 eggs in boiling water for 5 minutes.
Immediately transfer eggs to an ice water bath to cool.
This will prevent the eggs from cooking further and will ensure a nice soft-boiled egg.
In a food processor, combine the chicken, onion, garlic, ginger, cumin, chili powder, garam masala, and coriander, and blend.
Peel the eggs.
Press out the chicken mixture into 5 patties, roll the eggs in flour and wrap the patty around.
Whisk the remaining eggs together.
Roll the chicken-wrapped egg in flour, then egg wash, and finish in breadcrumbs.
Repeat for each egg.
Heat oil to 170˚C (325˚F) and fry each egg for about 5 minutes, until golden brown on all sides.
Serve hot or cold!
Enjoy!
