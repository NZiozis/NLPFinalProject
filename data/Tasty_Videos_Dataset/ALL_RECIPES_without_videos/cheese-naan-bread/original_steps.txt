Transfer the dough to a floured surface and divide it into 6 pieces. Take a piece and roll it into a ball. Roll it out to a round about â…› inch (3-mm) thick using a rolling pin. Repeat with the remaining dough.
Put a third of the cheese into the center of the dough. Top with another dough round and crimp the edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining cheese and dough.
Heat a medium nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add a filled naan round and cook for 3 minutes, until lightly browned.
