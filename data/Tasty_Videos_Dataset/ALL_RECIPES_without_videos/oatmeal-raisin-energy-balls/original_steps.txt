Place almond flour and dates in a food processor and pulse until sticky.
Add the raisins, almond butter, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt, and pulse until a sticky dough forms. Add 1 tablespoon of water if batter seems too dry.
Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the rolled oats.
Roll the mixture into tablespoon-sized balls and let sit at room temperature for 2-4 hours.
Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
Enjoy!
