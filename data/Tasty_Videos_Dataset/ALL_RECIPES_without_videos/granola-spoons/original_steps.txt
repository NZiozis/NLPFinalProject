Pour the granola into a food processor. Pulse until the granola is broken into small pieces. Set aside.
In a small saucepan, mix together the butter, honey, and brown sugar over medium-low heat. Stir until the butter is melted, the sugar is dissolved, and the mixture begins to bubble, about 5 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and add ½ cup (60g) of the crushed granola. If mixture is still too wet to shape, add more granola.
Wrap 4 spoons tightly in aluminum foil. Lightly grease with nonstick cooking spray and set on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
When the granola mixture is cool enough to handle, mold onto the front of each foil-covered spoon.
Freeze for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Place another piece of aluminum foil under the spoons. Fold it up around the edges of each spoon so the granola mold is nestled inside.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Cool the spoons for 10 minutes, then remove the granola spoons from the molds.
Chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Serve with yogurt, if desired.
Enjoy!
