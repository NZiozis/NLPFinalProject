Warm the tortillas in the microwave in 30-second intervals, until flexible. Transfer to a clean work surface.
Spread on half the pesto on each tortilla.
Divide the tomatoes, turkey, spinach, and provolone between the tortillas.
Wrap the tortillas tightly in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes.
Stick 6 toothpicks 1-inch (2 cm) apart into the wraps along the seam.
Slice between the toothpicks and serve.
Enjoy!
