In a large bowl, add the chocolate cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs and whisk until well combined.
Add the batter to a 9x13 inch (23x33cm) oven proof baking dish, and bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Add the pudding mix and milk to a bowl. Whisk until well combined. Fold in the whipped cream and crushed cookies until evenly incorporated.
Let the cake rest for 20 minutes.
Using the base of a wooden spoon, poke holes in the cake and fill with the gummy worms.
Drizzle the cake with chocolate fudge sauce.
Use a spatula to spread the whipped cream and cookie mixture over the cake.
Transfer to the fridge to chill for 1 hour.
Top the cake with remaining gummy worms and crushed cookies.
Enjoy!
