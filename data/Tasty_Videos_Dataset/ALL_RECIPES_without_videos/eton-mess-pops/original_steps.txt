Add the strawberries, two crushed meringue nests and double cream to a large mixing bowl, and whisk until thick.
Transfer the mixture into shot glasses, then place lolly sticks into them.
Freeze until solid.
Take the pops out of the glass and dip in melted white chocolate, then roll in more crushed meringue.
Freeze again if necessary.
Enjoy!
