In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, Worcestershire sauce, sesame seeds, garlic powder, onion powder, sesame seeds, salt, and black pepper.
Add the pretzels and toss to coat.

Set aside to cool completely.
In a food processor combine the cheese, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper, and pulse to combine.
With the processor running, slowly pour in the beer, blending until the mixture is smooth and spreadable.
Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste.
Transfer the beer cheese to a serving bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
