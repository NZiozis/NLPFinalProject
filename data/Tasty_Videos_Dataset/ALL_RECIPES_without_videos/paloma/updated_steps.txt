In a medium bowl, combine the grapefruit rinds and sugar.
Toss to coat the rinds with the sugar, then cover.
Let sit, stirring every 45 minutes, for about 4 hours, or until the sugar is completely dissolved and thereâ€™s syrup in the bottom of the bowl.
Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, pushing to extract as much syrup as possible.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine the tequila, lime juice, and simple syrup.
Shake vigorously for 20 seconds.
Strain into a glass filled with ice and top with club soda.
Garnish with the grapefruit wedge.
Enjoy!
