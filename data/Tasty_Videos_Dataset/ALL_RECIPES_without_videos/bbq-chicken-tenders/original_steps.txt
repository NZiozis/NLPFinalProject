Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Slice the chicken into even strips.
Dip the chicken strips into the BBQ sauce, then coat them in the bread crumbs.
Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 15 minutes.
Brush the remaining BBQ sauce evenly on both sides of the chicken strips and bake for another 10 minutes and serve.
Enjoy!
