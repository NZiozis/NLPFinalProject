Once the sugar has dissolved, simmer for 30 minutes and reduce.
Pour simple syrup through a strainer and remove excess liquid, then let it cool to room temperature.
In a blender, combine simple syrup, honeydew, and the remaining lime juice.
Blend until well-combined.
Pour into an 8Ã—8 inch (20x20 cm) baking dish and freeze for at least 12 hours.

Serve.
Enjoy!
