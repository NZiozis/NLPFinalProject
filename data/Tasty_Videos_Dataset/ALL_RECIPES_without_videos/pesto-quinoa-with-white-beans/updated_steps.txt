In a food processor, add the basil, arugula, ⅓ cup (80 ml) olive oil, the walnuts, lemon juice, ¾ teaspoon salt, the garlic, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and the water, and pulse until smooth.
Set aside.
Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the zucchini and cook for 3-4 minutes, until slightly tender.
Season with salt and pepper and cook for another 2 minutes, until lightly browned.
Add the white beans and sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 3-4 more minutes, until the beans begin to crisp.
Add the pine nuts and cook for 2-3 more minutes, until toasted.
Transfer the zucchini mixture to a medium bowl with the quinoa.
Add the pesto and stir until well-combined.
Distribute the quinoa into airtight containers and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
Enjoy!
