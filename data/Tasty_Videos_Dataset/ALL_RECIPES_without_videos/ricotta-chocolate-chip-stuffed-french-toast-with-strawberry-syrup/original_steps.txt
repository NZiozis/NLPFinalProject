Mix the eggs with the milk and sugar.
Spread all the bread slices with ricotta cheese, and top half of the bread slices with mini chocolate chips.
Sandwich each chocolate chip half with a plain ricotta half, and drench both sides in the egg mixture.
Coat a medium heat skillet with butter, and cook the bread until slightly brown and all the egg is cooked.
To make the syrup combine all syrup ingredients in a saucepan, and bring to a boil.
Let the liquid reduce by about a third, until the mixture is thick like a syrup.
Enjoy!
