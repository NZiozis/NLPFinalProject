Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast for about 8 minutes, until fragrant and browned. Let cool, then remove the skins by gently rubbing with a kitchen towel.
Increase the oven temperature to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a food processor, combine the buckwheat flour, hazelnuts, rosemary leaves, 3 tablespoons of maple syrup, and the salt. Pulse until the hazelnuts break down and the mixture resembles a coarse meal.
Add the butter and pulse to combine, until no large chunks of butter remain.
Press the crust into a 10-inch (25-cm) tart pan. Poke holes all over the bottom of the crust with a fork.
Bake the crust for 10 minutes.
Reduce the oven temperature to 375˚F (190˚C).
Spread the orange marmalade over the bottom of the warm crust. Arrange the brie slices evenly over the marmalade.
Shingle the pear slices neatly around the outside edge of the tart, packing them close together. Add a second layer around the outside edge, on top of the first layer. There should be a circle left in the center of the tart. Begin tucking pear slices horizontally, skin-side up, around the edge of the inner circle. Work toward the center, using smaller slices as the circle gets smaller (the thinner the better here, they will bend and not break!). Once you get to the very middle, tuck a few small slices into the center to fill in.
Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the remaining tablespoon of maple syrup over the pear slices.
Bake for 40 minutes, until the pears have softened.
Let cool for 10 minutes before slicing.
Enjoy!
