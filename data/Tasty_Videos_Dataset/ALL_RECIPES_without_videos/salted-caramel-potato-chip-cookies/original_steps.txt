Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a bowl, mix butter, and sugar until very fluffy (about 10 minutes).
Add vanilla and half of the flour. Mix. Add the rest of the flour. Mix.
Stir in potato chips, and roll dough into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) balls.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the edges turn brown.
In a saucepan, melt the caramels with the heavy cream.
Drizzle over cookies, and immediately top with coarse sea salt.
Enjoy!
