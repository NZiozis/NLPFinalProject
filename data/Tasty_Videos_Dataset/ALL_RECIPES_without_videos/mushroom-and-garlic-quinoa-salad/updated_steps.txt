In a medium-sized frying pan combine oil, mushrooms, thyme, and salt, then mix.
Allow to cook about 5 minutes.
Add the garlic, cook for 6-8 more minutes minutes until mushrooms are sufficiently cooked through and beginning to crisp up.
Set mushroom mixture aside.
Combine vegetable stock and water in pan, bring to a boil, then add quinoa and cover.
Simmer for 12-15 minutes.
Add mushroom mixture to quinoa and garnish with grated cheese of your choice (optional).
Enjoy!
