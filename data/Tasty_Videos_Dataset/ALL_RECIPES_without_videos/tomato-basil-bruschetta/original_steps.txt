Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).
Slice the baguette into ½-inch (1 cm) rounds and place on a baking sheet.
Brush both sides of the baguette slices with olive oil.
Bake for for 6 minutes until slightly crispy.
In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, minced garlic, balsamic vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper.
Rub the garlic into one side of the baguette slices, then spoon the tomato mixture evenly across the slices.
Enjoy!
