Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Cut the bread diagonally to form diamond shapes, making sure not to cut all the way down to the base of the bread.
Place the pieces of white cheddar between cuts.
Cover with shredded mozzarella.
Sprinkle salt, pepper, parsley, and melted butter on top.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until all the cheese is melted and the bread is lightly toasted.
Enjoy!
