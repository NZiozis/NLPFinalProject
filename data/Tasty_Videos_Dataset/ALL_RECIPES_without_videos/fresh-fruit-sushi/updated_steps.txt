In a medium pot combine the rice, water, sugar and salt.
Cook on low heat for about 20 minutes or until all the rice absorbs the water.
Add the coconut milk and vanilla.
The mixture should be moldable.
Cook a few minutes longer if it’s too runny.
Slice fruit of choice into long pieces.
*Note: Use a potato peeler to shave thin slices off the mango.
Lay a bamboo rolling pad on a counter top, and place a square of wax paper over top.
Spread the rice about ½ inch (1 cm) thick over the paper into approximately a 7x5 inch (17x12 cm) rectangle.
Toast a ¼ cup (25g) of coconut shreds for 3 minutes.
Lay the fruit pieces on the rice, and roll up carefully.
If rice sticks to the paper too much, try spreading it a little thicker.
Coat the rolls with either the mango slices, or the toasted coconut.
Slice each roll into 6 pieces.
With the rest of the rice, roll into balls (like nigiri).
Place thin slices of kiki or strawberries over top with half a blackberry on top to look like fish eggs.
Blend ¼ cup (25 g) raspberries with ¼ cup (60 ml) water to make a dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
