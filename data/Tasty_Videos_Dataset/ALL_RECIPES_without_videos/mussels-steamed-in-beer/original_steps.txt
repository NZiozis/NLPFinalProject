Heat the oil in a large pot over high heat and swirl to evenly coat. Add the onion, garlic, and jalape√±o. Cook, stirring, until softened, 4 minutes.
Add the cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened and their liquid is almost evaporated, 4 minutes.
Pour in the beer and bring to a boil.
Add the mussels, immediately cover the pot, and cook, occasionally shaking the pot, until all mussels are opened, 6 minutes.
Sprinkle the mussels with the chopped cilantro leaves, then divide among 4 bowls.
Garnish with whole cilantro leaves and serve the mussels while hot with lime wedges for squeezing and bread for soaking up the cooking broth.
Enjoy!
