Preheat oven to 350˚F (175˚C).
In a large bowl, combine softened cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract until well-incorporated.
Gently fold half of the strawberries into the mixture.
Open the crescent rolls and separate into individual triangles.
Drop one tablespoon of the mixture onto the wide end of the triangle and roll, starting at the wide edge.
Place on a baking sheet that has been lined with parchment paper. Bake for 13 minutes or until golden brown (times and temperatures may vary based on oven).
To make a strawberry glaze, mash the rest of the strawberries and powdered sugar. Continue mashing until all of the sugar has dissolved.
Drizzle glaze over crescent roll and sprinkle powdered sugar on top.
Enjoy!
