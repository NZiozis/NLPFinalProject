Cut each piece of jackfruit in half, then transfer to a slow cooker.
Add the onion, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, chili powder, cumin, bay leaves, vegetable broth, orange juice, and lime juice. Mix to combine.
Cover and cook on high for 3 hours or low for 6 hours.
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Uncover the slow cooker and remove the bay leaves. Using 2 forks, shred the jackfruit until it resembles the consistency of pulled pork.
Transfer the jackfruit to the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, or until the edges are slightly crisp.
Serve shredded jackfruit with tortillas, guacamole, black beans, corn salsa, and pico de gallo. The jackfruit will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Enjoy!
