In a large bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and coconut oil until combined.
Whisk in the oat milk and vanilla, until the sugar has dissolved and the batter is smooth.
Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix, until just combined.
Fold in the chocolate chips.
Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between each cookie and the edges of the pan so the cookies can spread evenly.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until cookies just begin to brown.
Let the cookies cool completely.
Use a serrated knife to slice the pint of ice cream pint into 1½-inch (4-cm) thick discs. Peel off the paper container from each ice cream slice.
Take 2 cooled cookies and sandwich an ice cream slice in between, pressing firmly.
Roll the edges of the ice cream sandwich in the chocolate chunks, if desired. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream.
Eat right away, or place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and freeze for 20 minutes.
The sandwiches will keep in the freezer for up to 6 months in an airtight container.
Enjoy!
