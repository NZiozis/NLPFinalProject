Place apples and honey in a food processor or blender and puree into a thick, smooth sauce.
Transfer the sauce to a sauce pan over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until enough moisture has cooked off that pools of liquid are no longer forming when running a spatula through the mixture, about 5-7 minutes.
Pour the sauce onto a baking tray lined with a silicone baking mat and smooth into a thin, even layer.
Bake for 6 hours at 175ºF (80ºC), until entire surface is just dry to the touch.
Once cool, turn the baking mat onto a cutting board and remove the silicone baking mat.
Roll the fruit sheet and cut into 1-inch (2 cm) pieces.
NOTE: If your fruit sheet comes out a bit too dry and you worry that rolling will cause it to crack, simply cover the surface with a few damp paper towels for a few minutes and try again. The moisture will rehydrate your fruit sheet just enough to be a flexible consistency.
Enjoy!
