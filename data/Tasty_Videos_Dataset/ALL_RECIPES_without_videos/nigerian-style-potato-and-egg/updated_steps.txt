Heat the oil in a medium nonstick pan over medium heat.
Add the onion, garlic, pepper, salt, and chili flakes, and cook for a 1-2 minutes, but donâ€™t let the onions brown.
Add the tomatoes, sardines, and baked beans, and cook for 4-5 minutes until the liquid reduces a bit.
Stir in the eggs and cook for about 2-3 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat.
Place a pat of butter on 3-4 potatoes, then spoon the egg mixture on top.
Enjoy!
