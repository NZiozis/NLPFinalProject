In a large bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form.
Add the condensed milk and coconut milk, then whip until smooth.
In a pan over medium heat, toast the coconut until browned, stirring constantly.
Fold the toasted coconut into the cream mixture.
Transfer the mixture to a baking pan or bowl, then freeze.
Enjoy!
