Cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut the larger half again horizontally, creating 3 cutlets.
Place the flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder into a wide shallow dish and stir to combine.
Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour mixture, shaking gently to remove any extra flour and set aside.
Heat oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in batches to prevent overcrowding.
Cook the chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side, 3 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
In the same pan, add more oil or butter as needed.
Add garlic, shallots, and the cremini mushrooms to the pan, stirring occasionally and scraping bottom the bottom of the pan until the mushrooms are soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes.
Deglaze the pan with the marsala wine and scrape all caramelized bits from the bottom of the pan.
Add the chicken stock and lemon juice, and allow mixture to come to a boil.
Reduce to simmer, and cook until the liquid has reduced by half. This can take about 30min
Remove the pan from the One Top and add 2 tablespoons of cold butter and stir until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Return the pan to the One Top and then add the cooked chicken to the sauce, let simmer for 5 more minutes. Make sure to flip the chicken halfway through.
Sprinkle with parsley and serve with pasta, potatoes, or rice.
Enjoy!
