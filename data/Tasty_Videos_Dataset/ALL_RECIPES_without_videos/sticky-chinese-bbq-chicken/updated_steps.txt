Season the chicken with salt and pepper.
Cut into bite-size chunks.
Dunk each chicken piece in the egg yolk, followed by the cornflour.
Set aside.
Heat the oil in a deep saucepan until it reaches 190°C (375°F).
Carefully fry the chicken pieces for around 5-6 minutes, until crispy, slightly golden in colour and cooked throughout.
Drain onto a plate covered in kitchen roll.
In a large saucepan over a medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil and fry the onions and peppers for 2-3 minutes.
Stir in the soy sauce, red wine vinegar, tomato paste, sugar, and chicken stock.
Cook for a further 2 minutes.
Add in cornflour paste.
Mix until the sauce has thickened.
Stir in the pineapple and chicken until evenly coated with the sauce.
Serve with rice.
Enjoy!
