In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheddar cheese, eggs, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ½ teaspoon of pepper, and mix well.
Grease a 24-cup mini muffin tin with nonstick spray and fill each cup with a heaping tablespoon of the bread crumb mixture.
Press into the pan firmly to form wells.
Set aside.
In another large bowl, combine the cream cheese, bacon, diced jalapeños, the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt, and remaining ½ teaspoon of pepper.
Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Fill the bread crumb wells with a 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture.
Top each cup with a bit of shredded cheddar and a jalapeño slice.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cups are golden brown.
Enjoy!
