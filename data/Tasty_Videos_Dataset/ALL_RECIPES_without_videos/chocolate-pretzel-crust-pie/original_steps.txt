Combine pretzels, butter, and brown sugar. Press mixture into pie pan.
Bake for 10 minutes or until golden. Let cool to room temperature.
Whisk cornstarch, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan.
Mix in egg yolks and milk, and heat mixture on medium heat. Gently mix for about 6 minutes or until the mixture thickens like a pudding.
Once thick, take the mixture off the heat and immediately add your chocolate, vanilla, butter, and lemon juice.
Mix until ingredients are incorporated into a smooth pudding texture.
Pour filling into the cooled crust and smooth with a spatula as desired. (Any extra filling can be saved in cups and eaten immediately, or chilled for pudding cups.)
Let the pie chill in the fridge uncovered for at least 4 hours.
Enjoy!
