Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
To prep cut off both ends of the butternut squash and poke 10-15 air vents with a fork. Microwave on high for 3-4 minutes.
Peel the skin off of the squash. The skin should peel right off! Once peeled, cut into 1x1-inch (2x2-cm) cubes.
In a large dutch oven or oven-safe pot, sauté onion in olive oil for 3-4 minutes or until semi-translucent. Add garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes.
Add the thyme and cook for 2 minutes, until fragrant.
Add arborio rice and sauté until lightly toasted, then stir in salt, pepper and white wine.
Stir in butternut squash and and vegetable broth and bring to a boil.
Cover pot and transfer to oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until liquid is absorbed.
Garnish with parsley and serve immediately
Enjoy!
