Cut each biscuit into 8 pieces. Set aside.
In a bowl, mix the eggs, milk, pepper, and salt. Set aside.
For the gravy: melt the butter in a saucepan, over medium heat. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper, and slowly add the 2 cups of milk.
Increase to medium-high, bring to a simmer, stirring until gravy is thickened.
In a greased 9x13 (22x33 cm) glass baking dish, layer the biscuits, sausage, cheese, egg mixture, and gravy.
Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 35-45 min, until the eggs on the bottom are cooked.
Enjoy!
