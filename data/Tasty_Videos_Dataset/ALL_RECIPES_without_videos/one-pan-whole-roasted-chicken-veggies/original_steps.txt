Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 425˚F (220˚C).
Toss the onion, carrots, and kale in a 12-inch (30 cm) cast iron skillet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and pepper until well coated. Pour the white wine over the vegetables.
Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper, then brush with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Stuff the rosemary, thyme, and lemon inside the cavity, tie the legs closed with kitchen twine, and tuck the wings underneath the bird. Place the chicken, breast-side up, on top of the vegetables in the skillet.
Roast the chicken for 1 hour, rotating the pan halfway through cooking. The chicken is done when it is golden brown, the skin is crispy, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 165˚F (70˚C). Remove from the oven and let the chicken rest for 15 minutes.
Carve the chicken, then plate alongside the vegetables. Pour the pan drippings over the top and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
