In a food processor, pulse the carrots until they reach your desired “rice” consistency.
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil, then add onions and let cook until translucent.
Add carrot rice, salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika, and cook until the tender, stirring occasionally.
Garnish with parsley.
Enjoy!
