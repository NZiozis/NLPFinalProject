In a large heavy bottomed pot, brown the beef in a little bit of olive oil. Season with the salt and pepper.
Once browned, remove the beef and set aside.
In the same pot, add the chopped onions. Cook until slightly softened. Add the browned beef back to the pan. Mix to incorporate.
Add the kidney beans, crushed tomato, cumin, paprika, red pepper flakes, chili powder, water and stout beer. Give it stir. Bring to a boil. Cover and let it simmer for an hour.
Serve with shredded cheddar, sour cream and chives.
Enjoy!
