Toss the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt, and pepper in a medium microwave-safe bowl, and microwave until tender, about 2 minutes.
Heat the tortillas in a dry skillet over low heat and fill with cooked sweet potatoes, black the beans, pico de gallo, and avocado. Garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
