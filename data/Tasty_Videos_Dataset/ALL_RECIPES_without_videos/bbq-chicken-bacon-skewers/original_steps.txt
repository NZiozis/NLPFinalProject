Preheat grill to medium heat.
Combine the chicken, bbq sauce, salt, and pepper, stirring until evenly mixed.
Threading one end of the bacon onto the end of a skewer. Add a piece of chicken, and weave the bacon around the chicken and back through the skewer, creating a wave pattern between the chicken. Move the bacon and the chicken down the skewer, repeating until the other edge of the bacon is threaded through.
Repeat on the rest of the skewers with the remaining chicken and bacon.
Grease the surface of the grill by rubbing the grates with tongs and an oiled paper towel.
Grill the skewers for about 12-18 minutes with the lid closed, flipping them halfway.
Enjoy!
