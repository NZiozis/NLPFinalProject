Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Grease a 9-inch (23-cm) round baking pan with nonstick spray.
In a medium bowl, combine the bacon bits and chili powder.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the crescent roll dough to a 12x6-inch (30x15 cm) rectangle.
Brush the dough with the melted butter
Sprinkle the bacon bits over the dough, leaving 1 inch (2 cm) of a long end empty for rolling.
Starting with the other long end, roll into a tube.
Slice the tube into 7 pieces and place in the prepared pan.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the rolls are light golden brown.
Drizzle with béchamel sauce to mimic icing.
Enjoy!
