Preheat Griddler, fitted with the grill plates, to 425°F (220°C), and grease with nonstick spray.
Using a sharp knife, slice the peaches in half, cutting around the pit.
Twist the two halves to separate and discard the pits.
Brush the cut sides of the peach halves with a bit of oil.
Place the peaches, cut side down, on the Griddler and close the press so that the top plate is touching all the peaches evenly.
Cook for 4 minutes, until the peaches have developed dark grill marks.
Transfer the peaches to a serving plate and top with Greek yogurt, a drizzle of honey, and a sprinkle of granola.
Garnish with mint leaves and serve.
Enjoy!
