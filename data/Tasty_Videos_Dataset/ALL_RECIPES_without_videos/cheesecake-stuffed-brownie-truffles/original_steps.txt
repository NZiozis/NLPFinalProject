Flip the prepared brownies onto a cutting board. Using a rolling pin, roll out the brownies to about Â¼-inch (6.5 mm) thickness. Cut into 16 equal squares.
In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Mix well and freeze for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Form the cheesecake mixture into 16 equal balls, about 1 teaspoon each.
Wrap a brownie square around each cream cheese ball.
Dip the wrapped truffle in the melted chocolate, covering the entire ball. Coat with graham cracker crumbs and chill for 30 minutes, or until ready to serve.
Enjoy!
