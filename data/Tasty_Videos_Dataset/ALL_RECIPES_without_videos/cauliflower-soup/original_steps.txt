On a cutting board, use a knife to remove the cauliflower florets. Discard the stem.
In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a rolling boil, season with salt, and add cauliflower. Cover and cook for 6-7 minutes, until a knife can easily run through the florets.
Transfer the cauliflower to a blender with a slotted spoon. Reserve the water.
Add cauliflower, pepper, and 1 cup (235 ml) of cauliflower stock to a blender and blend until a smooth consistency is reached.
Enjoy!
