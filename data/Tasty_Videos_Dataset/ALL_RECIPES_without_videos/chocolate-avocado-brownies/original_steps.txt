Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
In a blender or food processor, combine avocado, eggs, honey and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth, scraping down sides as necessary.
In a large bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder.
Combine the wet and dry mixtures and fold until a batter forms. Pour batter into a greased 8x8 inch baking pan.
Bake for 20-30 minutes. Allow to cool.
Enjoy!
