Preheat the oven to 425°F (220˚C).
Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat until shimmering.
Add the ground lamb, season with salt and pepper, and fry for 5 minutes, until cooked through.
Add the onion, carrots, garlic, thyme, and rosemary, stir, and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the veggies are softened and the meat is well-browned.
Add the tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce and stir to incorporate.
Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the liquid evaporates and the meat is aromatic.
Pour in the red wine and reduce until almost completely evaporated.
Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and cook the meat until the stock has evaporated, 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender.
Drain, then return to the hot pan over low heat to dry out a bit.
Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and mash until smooth.
Add salt, the butter, egg yolks, sour cream, and Parmesan cheese.
Fold until well combined.
Transfer the potatoes to a piping bag or zip-top bag fitted with a star tip.
Spoon the lamb mixture into a large baking dish.
Pipe the golden mashed potatoes over the lamb.
Bake for 30 minutes, until the potatoes are golden brown.
Enjoy!
