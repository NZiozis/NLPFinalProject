Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Using a vegetable peeler, peel long strips from the zucchini.
In a large bowl, mix the zucchini strips, shrimp, bell pepper sliced, lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil until the mixture is evenly coated.
On a roasting tray, spread the mixture into one even layer and bake for 8 minutes.
Enjoy!
