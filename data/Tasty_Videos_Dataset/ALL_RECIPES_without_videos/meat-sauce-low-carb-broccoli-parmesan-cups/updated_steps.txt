Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a food processor add the broccoli, 1 cup (110g) of Parmesan, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
Pulse until mixture forms a dough like texture, about 2 minutes.
Place 1 tablespoon of the broccoli mixture and press into a well greased muffin tin.
Form the mixture into a cup, making the bottom and sides ½-inches (1 cm) thick.
Bake for about 30 minutes until the edges are golden and crispy and the bottom is firm.
Cool the broccoli cups.
Once cooled, remove from the muffin tin.
Heat the oven to broil.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.
Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon, and stir until browned.
Add the sausage, breaking it apart with a spoon, and stir until browned.
Mix in 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan, salt, pepper, 3 tablespoons of the basil, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley, and stir to combine.
Add the tomato sauce and the tomato paste.
Continue stirring until the meat sauce is bubbling.
Reduce heat to low, and cover the pot, simmering for 45 minutes.
Place about a ¼ cup (65 g) of the ragu in the broccoli Parmesan cups.
Top with mozzarella cheese.
Broil for 2 minutes until cheese is melted.
Top with the rest of the basil.
Broccoli Parmesan Cups can be stored up to 3 days and can be reheated in the oven.
Enjoy!
