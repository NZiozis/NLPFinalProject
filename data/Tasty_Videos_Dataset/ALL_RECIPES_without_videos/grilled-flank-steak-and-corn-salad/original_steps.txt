In a medium bowl, drizzle the corn with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Massage the corn until fully coated. Set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the paprika, salt, brown sugar, chili powder, onion powder, cumin, garlic powder, chipotle powder, and black pepper and mix together.
Sprinkle the dry rub all over both sides of the flank steak. Rub in the spices.
On a heated grill or grill pan greased with canola oil, add the seasoned flank steak and cook until it begins to char slightly, about 3 minutes each side. Remove from the grill and let rest for at least 15 minutes to cool and keep the juices inside.
Add the seasoned corn to the grill pan. Cook until charred slightly, 3-5 minutes per side. Remove the corn from the grill and set aside to cool.
Set a small bowl upside-down inside a large bowl. Stand the corn cobs on the small bowl and cut off the kernels. Remove the small bowl.
Add the chiles, avocado, red onion, cherry tomatoes, jalapeños, lime juice, honey, salt, pepper, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix to combine.
Cut the meat into ½ inch (1 cm) slices.
Top with the corn salad and serve.
Enjoy!
