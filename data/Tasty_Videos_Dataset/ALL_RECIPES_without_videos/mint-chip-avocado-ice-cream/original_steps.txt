Add the avocados to a blender or food processor, along with honey, coconut milk, peppermint extract and salt.
Blend until smooth, scraping down sides as necessary.
Pour mixture into a freezer-safe dish and fold in the chocolate chunks.
Freeze for at least 2-3 hours. If freezing overnight, allow to defrost for 10-15 minutes for easier scooping.
Enjoy!
