Grease an 8-inch (20 cm) tart pan generously with coconut oil.
Add the almonds, cashews, dates, coconut, coconut milk, vanilla, and salt to a food processor and pulse until the nuts are finely ground and the crust starts to clump together.
Transfer the crust to the tart pan and use your hands to press it into an even layer.
Chill in the refrigerator while making the filling.
Add the avocados, coconut butter, cornstarch, key lime zest, key lime juice, maple syrup, coconut milk, vanilla, and salt to a food processor and blend until smooth and fully combined.
Pour the filling into the crust and spread into an even layer.
Garnish with shredded coconut, if desired.
Chill for at least 3 hours, or overnight, until the filling has fully set.
Enjoy!
