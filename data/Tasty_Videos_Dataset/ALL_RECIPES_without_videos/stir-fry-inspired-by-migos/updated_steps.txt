In a bowl, add the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, rice vinegar, peanut butter, garlic, and ginger, and whisk to combine.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large pan over high heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the cubed chicken and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Transfer the chicken to the bowl, and wipe the wok clean.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the cleaned wok over high heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the red onion, broccoli, and red cabbage, and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes.
Add the red bell peppers and snap peas and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the peppers begin to soften.
Add the carrots and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add the chicken, cooked rice noodles, and sauce, and stir until fully incorporated.
Serve with cilantro, scallions, and sesame seeds.
Enjoy!
