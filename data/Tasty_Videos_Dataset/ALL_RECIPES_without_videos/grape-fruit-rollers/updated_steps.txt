Preheat the oven to 170°F (80°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a food processor, combine the grapes, lemon zest, lemon juice, and honey.
Process until smooth.
Transfer the puree to a medium pan over medium-high heat and cook for 15 minutes, until thickened.
Spread the puree on the prepared baking sheet into an 8x11-inch (20x28-cm) rectangle about ¹⁄₁₆ inch (1 mm) thick.
Bake for 6 hours, or until no longer sticky to the touch.
Let cool completely.
Roll the fruit sheet in the parchment paper.
Trim the ends, then slice crosswise into 1-inch (2 cm) pieces.
Enjoy!
