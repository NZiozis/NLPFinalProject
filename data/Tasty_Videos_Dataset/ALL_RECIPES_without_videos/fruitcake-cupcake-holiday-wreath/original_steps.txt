Make the fruit: In a small pot, warm the orange juice over medium heat for 3 minutes.
Add the dried apricots, golden raisins, dried cherries, raisins, dried figs, and dried cranberries. Simmer for 5 minutes, until the fruit absorbs some of the liquid.
Transfer the fruit and their cooking liquid to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Soak and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight, then drain.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Make the cake batter: In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric hand mixer until fluffy.
Add the light and dark brown sugars and beat for 3 minutes, or until smooth and creamy.
Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and beat until well combined.
Add the vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and salt, and beat for 2 minutes, or until smooth.
Add the flour, baking soda, pecans, lemon zest, and the soaked fruit, and fold with a rubber spatula until well incorporated.
Grease 2 12-cup muffin tins with nonstick spray.
Using a 2-tablespoon ice cream scoop, add a scoop of batter to each of the muffin cups.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool before icing.
Make the icing: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth.
Drizzle the icing over the fruitcakes, then serve.
Enjoy!
