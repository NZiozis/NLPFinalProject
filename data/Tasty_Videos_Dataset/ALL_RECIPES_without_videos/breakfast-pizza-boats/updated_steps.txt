Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
In a small mixing bowl combine the mozzarella and feta and set aside.
On a large floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to an oval roughly 10 inches (25 cm) in length.
Transfer the dough to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Cover surface of dough with olive oil and spoon on cheese mixture leaving a 1 inch (2 cm) margin around the outside of the dough.
Fold in the 1 inch (2 cm) margin creating a crust around the cheese.
Brush the crust with egg wash.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Remove the baking sheet from oven and with a knife spread out some of the melted cheese in the center of the pizza boat and crack an egg into it.
Turn down heat to 400˚F (200˚C).
Bake for an additional 6-8 minutes.
Enjoy!
