Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Add the beef and stir to break up.
Season with the salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, paprika, and cayenne.
Stir and cook until deep brown in color, 10-15 minutes.
Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, chipotles, and a pinch of salt.
Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.
Add the tomato paste and cook until it darkens, becomes aromatic, and starts sticking to the bottom of the pan, 10 minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes, beef broth, black beans, and kidney beans.
Stir to incorporate, then bring to a boil.
Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
Ladle the chili over the fries and top with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and green onions.
Enjoy!
