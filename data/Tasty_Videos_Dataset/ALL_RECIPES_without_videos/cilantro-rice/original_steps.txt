In a medium saucepan, add the rice, bay leaves, and water and bring to a boil over high heat.
Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18 minutes.
Remove the lid, fluff the rice with a fork, and cover. Let rest and absorb any steam for 10 minutes.
Remove the bay leaves, then add the lime juice, lemon juice, salt, and cilantro. Stir to combine.
Enjoy!
