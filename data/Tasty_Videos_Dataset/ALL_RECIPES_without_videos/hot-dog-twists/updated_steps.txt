Skewer a hot dog the long way.
Cut a spiral by holding your knife at a diagonal to the hotdog and rolling it along your cutting board.
Remove skewer and set aside.
Cut a strip of puff pastry, it should be ½ inch (1 ³⁄₁₀ cm) wide and 1 and ½ in (4 cm) times the length of the hot dog you are using.
Wind a strip of puff pastry into the spiral groove you just made on the hot dog.
Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 20-30 minutes, until the dough is golden brown.
Serve with condiments of choice.
Enjoy!
