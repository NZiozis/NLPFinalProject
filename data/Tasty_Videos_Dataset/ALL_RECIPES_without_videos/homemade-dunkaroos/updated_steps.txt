In a bowl, mix the graham flour, butter, sugar, all purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon.
Mix well.
Add molasses to the milk, stir until fully combined and add it to the cookie dough.
Mix with your hands until fully combined.
Roll the dough using a rolling pin.
Roll from the center to the edges, moving clockwise to achieve a uniform thickness all around.
Preheat oven at 350ºF (180ºC)
Once your dough is about ⅙ of an inch (4 mm) in thickness, proceed to cut out shapes with any cookie cutter of about the size of a quarter.
Place your cookie on a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the cookies turn golden.
While the cookies cool, prepare the frosting by whipping the shortening, powdered sugar and the clear vanilla until fully combined.
Add the sprinkles and combine using a spatula.
Serve your cookies and frosting.
Enjoy!
