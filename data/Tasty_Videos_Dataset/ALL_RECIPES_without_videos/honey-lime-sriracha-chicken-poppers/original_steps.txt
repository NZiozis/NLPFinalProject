Cut chicken breasts into cubes.
In a medium-sized bowl, combine chicken, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger. Toss until evenly coated.
Place flour and beaten eggs into two separate bowls. Roll each piece of chicken in flour. Then, dip each piece into the eggs until fully covered. Dip into flour one last time for another coat.
Heat oil to 375°F (190°C) in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Fry the coated chicken pieces, in batches, until golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, honey, Sriracha, soy sauce, and lime juice.
Add chicken and stir until completely covered.
Serve with ranch, blue cheese, or honey!
Enjoy!
