In a large bowl, combine bacon, 2 cups (200 grams) of cheese, onions, and garlic powder. Distribute half of the mixture to a small bowl.
Spoon a heaping spoonful of bacon mixture at the bottom of each tortilla.
Fold the ends of the tortilla over the mixture and continue to roll, tightly.
Place tortillas seam side down into a greased casserole dish.
In medium bowl, whisk together remaining bacon mixture, 6 eggs, milk, salt, and pepper.
Pour egg mixture over the top of the rolled tortillas.
Cover with foil, and store in fridge overnight, or until ready to bake.
Preheat oven to 350°F (180˚C).
Bake enchiladas for 35-40 minutes, or until eggs are fully cooked.
Remove the foil and top enchiladas with 1 ½ cups (150 grams) of shredded cheese.
Bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
Top with cilantro and avocado, if desired.
Serve warm with tomatoes and salsa, if desired.
Enjoy!
