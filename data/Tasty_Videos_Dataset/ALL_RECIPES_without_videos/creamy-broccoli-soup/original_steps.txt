Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-translucent. Add the garlic, salt, and pepper and cook for 2-3 minutes more, until the garlic is fragrant.
Add the mashed potatoes, broccoli, vegetable broth, and milk and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender.
Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth.
Stir in the nutmeg, then ladle into bowls.
Enjoy!
