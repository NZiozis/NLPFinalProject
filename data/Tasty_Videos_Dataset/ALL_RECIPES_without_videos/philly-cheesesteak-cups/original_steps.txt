Chop the green pepper, onion, mushrooms and thinly slice the rib eye steak.
Sautè chopped pepper and onions in a skillet with oil over medium heat for 5 mins. Add mushrooms and cook another 5 minutes. Set aside.
In another skillet, cook the sliced rib eye (the meat will cook in it’s own fat so no oil necessary!)
Once meat is cooked through, add the pepper mixture, season with salt to taste, pepper to taste, and garlic powder to taste.
Add milk and cream. Bring to a light boil, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens. Remove from heat.
Cut thawed pastry dough into 3-inch (7.5 cm) squares.
Place in a greased muffin tray.
Fill with ¼ cup cheesesteak mix and bake for 10-12 minutes at 400°F (200°C).
Take out of oven and cover with grated provolone cheese. Return to oven until cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
