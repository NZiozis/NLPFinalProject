Combine water, grenadine, and food coloring.
Using a pipette or an eyedropper fill the inner chamber of plastic vampire teeth with the grenadine mixture.
Freeze the filled vampire teeth.
Fill a clear glass with lemon-lime soda or any other clear carbonated beverage.
Place the frozen vampire teeth ice cubes on the rim of the glass.
The grenadine ice cube will melt into the drink and slowly turn the drink red.
Enjoy!
