Steep the chai tea bags in the warm milk for 3-5 minutes.
In a blender, combine the chai tea milk, pear, honey, vanilla, and cinnamon.
Blend on high speed for 3 minutes, or until completely smooth.
Transfer the chai pear mixture to a small saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until just warmed through.
Do not boil.
Pour into a mug and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
