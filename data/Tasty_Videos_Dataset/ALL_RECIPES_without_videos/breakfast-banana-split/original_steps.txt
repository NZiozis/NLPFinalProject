In a bowl, whisk yogurt, honey, and vanilla until smooth.
Transfer to a glass baking dish, and freeze for at least 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
In a bowl, mix oats and coconut oil together until all oats are coated with oil.
Add the sunflower seeds, almond slivers, dried cranberries, and 3 tablespoons of honey to the bowl, and mix to combine.
Pour the oat mixture onto a baking pan lined with parchment paper and spread and pat down till the pan is fully covered from end-to-end.
Bake for 20-30 minutes and mix the oats halfway through to allow them to cook evenly.
Add the halved banana to a plate and top with vanilla frozen yogurt, granola, and fruit of your choice.
Enjoy!
