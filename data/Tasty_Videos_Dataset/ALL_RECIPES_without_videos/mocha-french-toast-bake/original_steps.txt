Cut each biscuit into 4 pieces and place in a large bowl.
In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and instant coffee until well-blended.
Pour the liquid mixture over the biscuits and stir to coat.
Spoon half of the biscuit and liquid mixture into a greased 9x9-inch (22cm x 22cm) baking dish.
Place the chocolate bars on top and cover with the remaining half of the biscuit mixture.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the biscuits are no longer doughy on the inside and there is no more liquid.
Cool for 10 minutes and serve with a dollop of whipped cream and drizzle of chocolate syrup.
Enjoy!
