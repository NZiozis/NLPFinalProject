Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Cut off the top of the bread. Use a bread knife to cut around the inside of the bread and scoop the center out.
Cut all the removed bread into bite-sized cubes.
Mix two teaspoons of crushed garlic into the melted butter. Brush the garlic butter on the bottom and the inside walls of the bread boat.
Dip all the bread cubes in the remaining garlic butter, set aside.
Combine the cream cheese, cheddar, mozzarella, milk, remaining crushed garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.
Pour the cheese mixture into the bread boat.
Brush the top of the cheese mixture with egg yolk.
Place the bread boat and the bread cubes on a baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes, remove the croutons, and continue cooking the bread boat for another 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and a golden brown crust is formed.
Enjoy!
