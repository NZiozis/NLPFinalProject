Preheat oven to 450°F (230˚C).
In a large bowl, add the Brussels sprouts, onion, olive oil, salt, and pepper, and mix to combine.
Transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and add pears.
Bake for 15 minutes.
Stir once, then back for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the Brussels sprouts are golden brown and have started to crisp and the pears have caramelized.
Squeeze the lemon over the Brussels sprouts and drizzle with the honey.
Add the dried cranberries and stir to combine.
Bake for an additional 25-35 minutes.
Enjoy!
