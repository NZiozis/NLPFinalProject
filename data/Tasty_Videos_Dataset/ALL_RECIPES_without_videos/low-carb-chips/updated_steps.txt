1, Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Mix the shredded mozzarella and almond flour in a medium microwaveable bowl.
Stir until combined, then add the cream cheese.
Microwave for 1 minute.
Take out and stir until a dough-like texture forms.
Add the egg, cumin, and chili powder.
Mix until everything is well incorporated.
Place the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper.
Using a rolling pin, flatten dough into a thin layer.
The thinner the layer, the crispier the chips are!
Take off the top parchment paper layer.
Transfer the dough with the bottom piece of parchment paper to a baking sheet.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until browned on the top.
Remove from the oven and cut into squares with a pizza cutter or knife.
Serve with your favorite dip.
