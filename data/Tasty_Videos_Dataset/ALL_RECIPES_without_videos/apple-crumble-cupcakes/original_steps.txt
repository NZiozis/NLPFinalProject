Preheat oven to 160°C (325°F).
In a medium saucepan, cook the apple, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and the juice of half a lemon until soft and fragrant.
Mash until the mix resembles a paste. Let cool.
Cream the butter and brown sugar with a hand mixer in a large bowl, smoothing out with a wooden spoon if needed.
Sift in the flour, cornflour, baking powder, cinnamon, and ground cloves and mix until incorporated.
Add one of the eggs and mix in. Repeat twice until all three eggs are fully incorporated to make the batter. Fold in the apple mixture.
Pour cupcake mix into a muffin tin lined with cupcake cases. Fill about halfway. Bake for 30-35 minutes. Let cool.
In a small bowl, rub the flour, oats, brown sugar, and butter together with your fingers until you have a crumble. Transfer to a small tin and toast under the grill for 5-10 minutes until golden brown.
Top the cupcakes with whipped cream and the crumble mix.
Enjoy!
