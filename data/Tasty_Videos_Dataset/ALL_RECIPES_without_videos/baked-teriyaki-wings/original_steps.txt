Preheat oven to 400˚F/200˚C.
Remove excess moisture from chicken wings with a paper towel.
In a large bowl, stir in baking powder and salt until chicken is thoroughly coated.
Bake on a baking rack for 1 hour, or until golden brown and crispy, flipping every 20 minutes. (For best results, place baking rack on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper or foil to catch drippings).
In a skillet, combine soy sauce, honey, and brown sugar on medium heat. Bring to a boil and add in sesame seeds.
Once sauce is thickened, stir in chicken wings until fully coated.
Serve with your favorite side dish or dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
