Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
Slice pita bread into eighths and spread chips out on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and brush onto both sides of the chips.
Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden and crispy.
Allow to cool.
Enjoy!
