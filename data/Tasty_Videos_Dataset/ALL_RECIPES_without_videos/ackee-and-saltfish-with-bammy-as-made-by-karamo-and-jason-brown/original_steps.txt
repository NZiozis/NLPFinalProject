Make the bammy: Add the cassava to a food processor and pulse until finely shredded. Transfer to a clean towel and squeeze to extract excess liquid until the cassava is fully dry.
Transfer to a medium bowl and break up the cassava. Sprinkle in the salt and stir to distribute.
Heat an 8-inch (20 cm) skillet over medium-low heat. Carefully pour half of the cassava into the pan. Use a silicone spatula to pat the cassava into a disc. Cook the bammy for about 6-8 minutes on each side, until light golden brown..
Transfer the bammy to a shallow dish filled with the coconut milk and let soak for 1 minute. Do not let soak too long, or the bammy will fall apart.
Add 1 tablespoon of canola oil to the skillet and carefully transfer the bammy back to the pan. Fry for another 5 minutes on each side, until light golden brown. Repeat with the remaining cassava. Set aside.
Make the ackee and saltfish: Rinse the salted cod in a bowl with 4 cups (960 ml) of cold water. Drain and repeat twice more.
Add the rinsed cod to a small saucepan with 4 cups (960 ml) of water. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes. Drain and repeat once more.
Transfer the fish to a medium bowl. Use 2 forks or your hands to flake the fish into chunks. Set aside.
Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, red and green bell pepper, tomato, garlic, scotch bonnet, thyme, pepper, and salt. Sauté, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes, until slightly softened.
Add the ackee, flaked saltfish, and scallions and carefully fold in to the vegetables. Sauté for 4-5 minutes more, until warmed through. Season to taste with more salt if needed.
Slice the warm bammies into quarters, then serve with the ackee and saltfish.
Enjoy!
