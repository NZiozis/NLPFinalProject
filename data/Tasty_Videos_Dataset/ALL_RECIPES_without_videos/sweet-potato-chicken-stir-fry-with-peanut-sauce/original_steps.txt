In a small bowl, mix together peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and water until smooth. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix lime juice, sesame oil, salt, and pepper.
Add cubed chicken to mixture and stir until completely coated.
Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Heat a large skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat and add chicken. Cook for 4-6 minutes, or until no longer pink.
Once cooked through, remove chicken and transfer to a bowl.
Spiralize bell peppers and sweet potato into a large bowl.
Add sesame oil to the skillet. Once the oil is hot, add in the broccoli florets and cook for 2-3 minutes.
Add in the spiralized vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes.
Add in the chicken and peanut sauce and stir to coat. NOTE: Add additional water if sauce is too thick to coat.
Reduce heat to medium low and cook for 3-4 minutes, until sweet potato noodles are al dente.
Top with green onions and chopped peanuts.
Enjoy!
