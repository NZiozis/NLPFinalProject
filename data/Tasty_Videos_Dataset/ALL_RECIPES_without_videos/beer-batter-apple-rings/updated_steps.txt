Heat oil in a large pot so it’s at least 4 inches (10 cm) deep.
If you have a thermometer, be sure the oil reaches at least 360ºF (185ºC) for frying.
In a bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, and Redd’s Apple Ale until smooth.
Slice off the top and bottom of the apples, and slice each apple into ½-inch (1 cm) thick rounds.
With a teaspoon or large piping tip, cut out a circle in the center of the apple ring to make it look like a donut.
With a paper towel, pat down the apple slices.
Dip the apple slices in the batter.
Fry them two to three at a time.
Flip each apple slice once during frying and fry until both sides are golden brown.
Carefully remove from the oil and place onto paper towels or a drying rack.
Cool, then sprinkle with powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
