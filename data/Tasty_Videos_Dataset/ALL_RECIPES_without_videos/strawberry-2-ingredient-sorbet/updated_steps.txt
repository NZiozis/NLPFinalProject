Hull the strawberries by using a straw to push out the stem of each strawberry.
Cut strawberries in half and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and freeze until hardened.
Add the frozen strawberries and honey to a food processor and combine until evenly mixed.
Transfer to a loaf pan and transfer to freezer until completely frozen.
Enjoy!
