Preheat grill to medium heat.
Combine the chicken, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, and green onions, stirring until evenly coated.
Chill and marinate for at least 2 hours.
Slide a piece of chicken down the skewer, alternating with the pineapple, until there is a 1-inch gap on the top of the skewer.
Repeat with the remaining chicken, pineapple, and skewers.
Grease the surface of the grill by rubbing the grates with tongs and an oiled paper towel.
Grill the skewers for about 12-18 minutes with the lid closed, flipping them halfway. Brush the skewers with the leftover marinade during grilling, if desired.
Enjoy!
