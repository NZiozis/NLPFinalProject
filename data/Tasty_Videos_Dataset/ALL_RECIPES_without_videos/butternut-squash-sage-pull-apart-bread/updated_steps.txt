Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roast the squash: Add the butternut squash to the prepared baking sheet.
Drizzle with the olive oil and season with the salt and pepper.
Toss to coat.
Bake for 30 minutes, until the squash is tender and starting to brown around the edges.
Make the dough: Transfer the squash to a large bowl and mash until smooth.
In a separate large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, salt, ginger, sage, olive oil, and maple syrup
Stir with a wooden spoon until well mixed.
Add 1 cup (450 g) of the mashed butternut squash (save the rest for another use) and work with your hands until the dough begins to come together.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1-2 hours.
Make the maple olive oil: In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, maple syrup, and salt.
Once the dough has risen, roll out to about a 20-inch (51-cm) wide circle.
Brush with maple olive oil and sprinkle with the chopped sage
Cut the dough into about 1½-inch (4-cm) squares.
Roll up each dough square like a jelly roll.
Place the dough pieces in a greased 8½x4½-inch (21x11-cm) loaf pan with the cut sides up.
Loosely cover the loaf pan with a kitchen towel and let rise for 45 minutes.
Towards the end of proofing, preheat the oven to 350°F (180˚C).
Lightly brush the top of the proofed loaf with maple olive oil and garnish with the whole sage leaves.
Bake for 35 minutes, until golden brown.
If the top begins to brown too quickly, loosely cover with foil for the remainder of the cook time.
Let the bread cool for 15 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
