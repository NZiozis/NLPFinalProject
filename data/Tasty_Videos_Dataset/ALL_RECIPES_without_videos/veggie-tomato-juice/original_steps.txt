Add the tomatoes, carrot, celery, red bell pepper, salt, pepper, garlic, and water to a large pot and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.
Remove from heat, let cool for 10 minutes.
Add mixture to a blender and add in the parsley. Blend until consistency is smooth.
Serve chilled.
Enjoy!
