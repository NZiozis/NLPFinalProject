Blanch the corn in a large pot of boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove the corn from the pot.
Heat the canola oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add the corn and cook, turning occasionally, until nicely browned on all sides.
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce and sugar. Pour over the corn in the pan and brush over the corn until well coated. Transfer to a serving plate.
Enjoy!
