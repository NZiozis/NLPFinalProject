Prepare Brownie Mix according to directions on the box.
In a medium mixing bowl add two egg whites and beat until stiff peaks form (about 2-3 minutes).
Carefully fold in Brown Sugar until incorporated.
Pour Brownie Mix into greased 9x9 inch (23x23 cm) baking pan.
Top Brownie Mix with Pecans, Marshmallows, and Chocolate Chips.
Spread Brown Sugar Meringue evenly over brownie layer.
Bake in preheated oven at 350˚F (175˚C) for 35 minutes. If the top starts to brown too quickly - cover loosely with aluminum foil halfway through.
Remove from oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature.
Enjoy!
