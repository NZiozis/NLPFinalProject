Wash potatoes thoroughly and poke holes in each with a fork.
Place into a large bowl.
Sprinkle with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Make sure each potato is evenly coated.
Place on a baking sheet covered with foil.
Bake at 425˚F (220˚C) for 35 minutes, or until potatoes are tender enough that a fork can go through the center flesh easily.
Let cool for 10 minutes or until potatoes can be handled comfortably.
Cut off tips of both ends of each potato.
Using a melon baller or metal teaspoon, carve out the center each potato.
Set the tips and carvings aside in a large bowl to use as the filling.
(You may want to dice up the tips first so that they will mash easier).
Melt butter and mix into the large bowl with the potato filling.
Mash the potatoes with a fork until consistency is smooth.
Mix in sour cream, cheddar cheese, bacon, green onion, salt, and pepper and stir until well combined.
Using a small spoon, stuff each of the hollowed out potatoes with the filling.
Bake at reduced temperature 375˚F(190˚C) for 5-7 minutes.
Top each potato with cheddar cheese and bacon.
Return to oven and bake for 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Garnish with green onion.
Enjoy!
