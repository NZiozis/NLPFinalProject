Fry the onions, garlic, chilli, and red pepper with a little olive oil.
Add the chorizo after a minute.
Stir in the turmeric, salt, pepper, and long grain rice.
Pour in the water and simmer for 20 minutes.
Stir in the peas and prawns until prawns are pink and no longer translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
Enjoy!
