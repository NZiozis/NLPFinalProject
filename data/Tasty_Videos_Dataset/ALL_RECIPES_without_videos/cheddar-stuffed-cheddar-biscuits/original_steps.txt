Combine bisquick and butter together until you have a crumbly mix.
Add milk, dried parsley and shredded cheddar. The dough will be sticky.
Take a handful of dough, flatten, place a cube of cheese in the middle and roll the dough around the cube of cheese.
Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes at 450°F (232°C)
While the biscuits are baking, make the butter topping. Melt the butter and add in the garlic powder and old bay seasoning.
Once the biscuits are done baking, brush the butter topping over each biscuit.
Enjoy!
