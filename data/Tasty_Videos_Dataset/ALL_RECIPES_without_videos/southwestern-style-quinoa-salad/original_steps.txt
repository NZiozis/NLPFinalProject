Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and jalape√±o and cook for about 2 minutes, until softened.
Add the black beans, corn, tomatoes, quinoa, vegetable stock, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir, then cover and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender.
Transfer the salad to a serving bowl and top with the avocado, lime juice, and cilantro.
Enjoy!
