In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, lime juice, orange juice, garlic, jalapeño, chopped cilantro, salt, coriander, cumin, pepper, and chili powder.
Place the steak in a gallon-size resealable bag.
Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of the marinade and set the rest aside.
Seal the bag and shake to evenly coat the steak in the marinade.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 4 hours.
In a small saucepan, bring the reserved ½ cup (120 ml) of marinade to a boil over medium-high heat.
Cook until thickened and reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
Remove from the heat and set aside.
Heat a large grill pan over high heat until very hot.
Remove the steak from the bag and discard the marinade.
Cook the steak on 1 side until there are dark grill marks and it is beginning to caramelize around the edges, about 6 minutes.
Flip and cook on the other side for 5 minutes for medium rare, or 7 minutes for medium.
Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.
Working in batches, heat the corn tortillas in a pan over medium-high heat, turning with tongs, until softened and just beginning to brown in spots, about 1 minute per side.
Wrap the toasted tortillas in foil to keep warm.
Thinly slice the steak against the grain, then cut the slices in half.
Transfer to a large bowl and toss with the reduced marinade to coat.
Serve the steak with the warm tortillas, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, cotija cheese, and cilantro leaves, if desired.
Enjoy!
