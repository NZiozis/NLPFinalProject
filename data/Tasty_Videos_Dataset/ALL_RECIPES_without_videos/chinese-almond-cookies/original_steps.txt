In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together with an electric hand mixer for 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.
Add the egg, then 1 egg yolk, beating to incorporate after each addition.
Add the almond extract and beat to combine.
Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt into the bowl and beat for 3 minutes, or until a crumbly dough forms.
Turn out the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and fold the wrap over the dough on all 4 sides to create a square dough block about ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) thick. Refrigerate the dough for 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 325˚F (165˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Unwrap the dough on a cutting board and cut into 25 cubes.
Roll the dough cubes into balls, then flatten slightly and place on the prepared baking sheet.
In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg yolk with the water.
Brush a thick layer of egg wash onto the cookies.
Add the red food coloring to a small bowl. Dip the thicker end of a wooden chopstick into the food coloring and make a dot in the center of each cookie.
Bake for 35 minutes, or until the cookies are golden.
Let the cookies cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
