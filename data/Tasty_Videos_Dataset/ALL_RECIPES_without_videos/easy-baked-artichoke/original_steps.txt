Remove the stem of the artichoke. Cut about 1 inch (2 cm) off the top of the artichoke. Take a pair of kitchen scissors and snip off the thorns on the tip of the artichoke petals.
Take half a lemon and rub lemon juice over the cut portion of the artichoke to prevent it from browning. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Spread open the petals and rub minced garlic all over. Add the parsley and Parmesan; make sure to get it in between the petals. Top with more pepper if desired.
Wrap the artichoke in aluminum foil. Bake at 425°F (220°C) for one hour 20 minutes.
When done, serve with extra parsley, lemon wedge and your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
