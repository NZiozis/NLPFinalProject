Remove seeds and veins from 6 chillies. (Wearing latex gloves for this part is advised.)
Refrigerate chillies in vodka for 4-12 hours.
Melt dark chocolate and stir in black pepper
Dip the chillies in the dark chocolate, coating fully, and rest on some baking paper
Drizzle with melted white chocolate. Quick tip: you can make white chocolate thinner by stirring a teaspoon of vegetable oil to it after itâ€™s melted.
Leave to set in the fridge (about 30-60 minutes).
Enjoy!
