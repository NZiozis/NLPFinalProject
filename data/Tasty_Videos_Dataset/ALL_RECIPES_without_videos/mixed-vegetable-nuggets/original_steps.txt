In a small bowl, combine the water and flax meal and stir to combine. Let sit for 10 minutes. Set aside until ready to use.
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a food processor, combine the broccoli and carrots, and pulse until shredded. Add the cauliflower and pulse until shredded.
Add the salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic, and flax egg, and pulse until well combined. Add 1¼ cups (145 g) of the bread crumbs and mix.
Take about 1 tablespoon of the mixture and form it into a nugget with your hands. Repeat with remaining mixture.
Coat the nuggets on both sides with the remaining ¾ cup (85 g) of bread crumbs.
Bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown.
Or, pan fry with a small drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
