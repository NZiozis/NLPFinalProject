Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and then the cajun spice mix (store-bought or homemade)
Sear the chicken breasts on each side for about 2 minutes, then remove from the pan.
Add some more oil and fry the onions and peppers until softened.
Add the black beans and fry for a couple of minutes.
Add the rice and fry for a further minute.
Place the chicken back on and cover in chopped tomatoes.
Add chicken stock and more cajun spice (to taste).
Bring to boil, then cover and simmer for 25 minutes.
Enjoy!
