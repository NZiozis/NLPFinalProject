Preheat oven to 375˚F/190˚C.
Prepare sauce in a small bowl and set aside.
Combine all other ingredients (except for the cheese) in a large bowl until evenly distributed.
Add in half of the meatloaf mixture to a greased loaf pan and flatten to form an even layer.
Add slices of cheese to form a thin layer on top of the meatloaf.
Fill loaf pan with remainder of meatloaf, smoothing out the final top layer.
Top meatloaf with half of the tomato sauce mixture, using a spoon or rubber spatula to cover the top evenly.
Reserve the other half of the tomato sauce.
Bake for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reads 160˚F/70˚C when poked with a meat thermometer.
When the meatloaf is ready, heat your tomato sauce in the microwave or on a skillet, and drizzle on top of your meatloaf.
Garnish with fresh chopped parsley.
Serve with your favorite sides.
(We used mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus.)
Enjoy!
