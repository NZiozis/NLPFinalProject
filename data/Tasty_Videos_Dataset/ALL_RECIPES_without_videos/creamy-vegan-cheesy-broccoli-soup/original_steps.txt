In a large soup pot, add the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and stir until translucent.
Add the carrots, potatoes, garlic, and salt, and stir. Add 2 cups (480 ml) of vegetable broth, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.

Set the soup aside and rinse out blender. Add remaining vegetable broth, cashews, nutritional yeast, paprika, and pepper, and blend until smooth.
Combine the cashew mixture and “cheese” mixture in the soup pan and stir.
