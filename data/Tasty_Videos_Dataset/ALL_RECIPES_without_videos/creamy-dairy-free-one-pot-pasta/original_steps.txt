Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for 3 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the tomatoes and cook for 3-5 more minutes, until the skins begin to wrinkle and tomatoes begin to release liquid.

Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce heat, and let simmer for 10 minutes or until most liquid is absorbed.
Add in spinach and stir until wilted.
Add in the nutritional yeast and stir until combined.
Remove from heat and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
