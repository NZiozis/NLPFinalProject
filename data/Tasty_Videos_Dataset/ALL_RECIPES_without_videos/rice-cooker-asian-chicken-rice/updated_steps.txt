Put washed rice, garlic, ginger, salt, chicken bouillon, and water in a rice cooker pot and mix well.
Add chicken thigh to the pot skin-side down, and place the scallion over the chicken.
Cook for 30 minutes, or until the rice and chicken are cooked through.
For sauce, combine scallion, white sugar, sesame oil, grated garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, miso, and red chili flakes.
Mix well.
When the rice is ready, remove scallion and chicken.
Stir the rice well to fluff it up and slice the chicken.
Press cooked rice into a bowl to make a dome shape.
Then turn the bowl upside down onto the serving plate.
Serve the sliced chicken with cilantro, tomatoes, and lemon, and pour the sauce over to your preference.
Enjoy!
