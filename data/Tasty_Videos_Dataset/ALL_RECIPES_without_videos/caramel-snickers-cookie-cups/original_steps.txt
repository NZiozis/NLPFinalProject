Get a muffin tin and coat with vegetable oil spray.
Place a cookieâ€™s worth of dough into each section of a muffin tin. Press the dough down to make a cup shape.
Bake for 10-12 minutes.
As soon as the cookies are removed from the oven, place one snickers bar in each cookie cup.
Let cool and cover with caramel just before serving.
Enjoy!
