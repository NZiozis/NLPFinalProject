Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Cut sweet potato into fries and combine in a large bowl with olive oil, rosemary, salt, and pepper.
Place in a single layer on a baking sheet lined in parchment paper. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, flipping halfway through.
Prepare dip while fries are baking. Combine all dip ingredients in a small bowl and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Enjoy!
