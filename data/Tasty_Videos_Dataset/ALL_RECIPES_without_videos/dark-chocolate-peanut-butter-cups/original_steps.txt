In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the dark chocolate and 5 tablespoons of coconut oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until melted. Add the vanilla and stir until combined. The mixture should be smooth and pourable.
Pour ½ of the chocolate mixture into the molds, enough to cover the bottom of the mold and come about ⅓ of the way up the sides. Freeze for 15 minutes.
In another microwave safe bowl, mix together the peanut butter, honey, and remaining 2 tablespoons of coconut oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth and pourable.
Pour the peanut butter mixture evenly over the chocolate layers in the molds. Make sure to leave enough room for the second layer of chocolate. Freeze for 10 minutes.
Pour the remaining chocolate on top of the peanut butter layer, up to the rims of the molds. Wipe off any excess that spills over the edges. If desired, sprinkle the cups with hemp hearts for added crunch. Freeze for 1 hour, until set, then pop out of the molds.
The cups will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
Enjoy!
