Heat the canola oil (for the veggies) in a pan over high heat.
Cook the peppers, onion, salt, and pepper until soft and slightly caramelized.
Transfer the cooked veggies to a bowl.
In the same bowl, mix in the cream cheese, cheddar, and pepper jack, stirring until evenly incorporated.
Set aside.
In a separate bowl, combine the chicken with the salt, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder, evenly distributing the spices over the chicken.
On a cutting board, slice a pocket in the chicken horizontally.
Fill the pocket with a heaping spoonful of the veggie mixture.
Press the edges of the chicken together to seal in the filling.
Repeat with the remaining chicken.
Heat the canola oil in a pan over medium heat.
Cook the stuffed chicken for five minutes on each side, until cheese is melted and chicken is cooked through.
Serve with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole!
Enjoy!
