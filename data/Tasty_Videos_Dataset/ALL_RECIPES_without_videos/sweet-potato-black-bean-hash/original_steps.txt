Heat olive oil on medium heat in a 4-quart chicken fryer. Add sweet potatoes, onion, pepper, salt, pepper, paprika, and cumin, and stir. Cook for 10 minutes, occasionally stirring.
Add spinach and cook for an additional five minutes.
Lastly, add the black beans and stir until all ingredients are well-blended.
NOTE: We topped our hash with an egg and avocado slices.
Enjoy!
