Pierce orange with cloves. (If you have a tea infuser, tea bag or cheese cloth, you can use that to keep the spices under control).
Pierce apple with allspice.
Put the orange, apple, cinnamon sticks, apple cider, brown sugar and nutmeg into your slow cooker.
Turn on high for 2 hours, then keep warm on low until youâ€™re ready to drink.
Drink as is or with a shot (or two) of whiskey, rum, etc.
Enjoy!
