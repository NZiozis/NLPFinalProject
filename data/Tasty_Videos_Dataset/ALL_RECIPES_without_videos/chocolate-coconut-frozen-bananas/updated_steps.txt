Cut the bananas in half horizontally.
Insert popsicle sticks in the middle of the banana halves.
Transfer bananas to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and freeze until solid.
In a tall glass or mixing cup, add chocolate and coconut oil.
Microwave in 30-second intervals for 1 minute and a half, and mix until smooth.
Place coconut onto a plate.
Dip the bananas into the chocolate coating, then roll or sprinkle on toppings.
Place bananas in freezer until the coating has hardened.
Enjoy!
