Add the fenugreek, turmeric, asafoetida, mustard seeds, and curry leaves to the pan, and fry for a couple of minutes.
Add the paste and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes.
Add the prawns and water.
Cook until they start to turn pink.
Pour in the coconut milk, salt, pepper, and lime juice, and cook for another few minutes.
