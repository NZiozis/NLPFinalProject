Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C) (or 350째F (180째C) on a convection oven).
In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, ground sausage, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, and egg together with your hands until thoroughly combined.
Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized balls. Use your thumb to create a dent in the balls, add a bit of mozzarella and seal.
Cut the bacon rashers in half and roll around the meatballs.
Place the meatballs on a foil-covered tray and bake for 20 minutes.
Remove from the oven and brush with BBQ sauce, then bake for 5 minutes more. Repeat brushing and baking two more times for an extra-thick layer of BBQ sauce.
Enjoy!
