Bring a medium pot with about 1 cup (240 ml) of water, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan by an inch (2 cm), to a boil.
Add the beaten egg to a ramekin and sprinkle in a pinch of salt.
While slowly stirring with a fork, pour in the remaining water.
Cover with foil and place the ramekin into the boiling water.
Cover and steam for 12 minutes.
Uncover, carefully remove the ramekin, and take off the foil.
Top with chives if you like.
Enjoy!
