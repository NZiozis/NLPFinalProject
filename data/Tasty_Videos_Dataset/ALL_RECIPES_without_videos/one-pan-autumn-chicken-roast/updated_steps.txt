Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
On a baking sheet, toss the sweet potato, Brussels sprouts, and sliced apples so they’re evenly distributed.
Lay the chicken thighs on top.
Drizzle the olive oil over the chicken, fruit, and veggies, and season with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle with the garlic, rosemary, and thyme.
Turn the chicken over and season on the other side, then return to skin-side up.
Bake for 30 minutes, then broil for 5 - 10 minutes so the chicken skin gets golden brown and crispy.
Enjoy!
