Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Make the xawaash: In a medium bowl, combine the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and nutmeg. Set aside.
Heat a medium oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil, onion, tomato, garlic, and cinnamon stick. Cook until the onions have softened slightly, 5-6 minutes.
Season with salt, then add the vegetable stock cube and cilantro. Cook for 1 minute, breaking up the stock cube.
Reduce the heat to medium, then stir in the xawaash and soaked rice. Cook for about 3 minutes so rice grains lightly toast.
Pour in the hot water and increase the heat to high to bring to a boil. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Check periodically to be sure the rice has enough water.
Remove the cooked rice from the oven and drizzle the red and orange food colorings on top. Gently mix so there are different colored grains.
Sprinkle the raisins over the hot rice, cover, and set aside.
To prepare the topping, mix the potatoes with the orange food coloring in a medium bowl (wear gloves to avoid stained fingers!).
Heat about 1 inch ( 2 cm) of oil in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the potatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes, then transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil.
In the same oil, fry the onion slices until browned and crispy, 2-3 minutes. Add the red peppers cooking for an additional minute. Drain on paper towels.
To assemble the rice, transfer the pilaf to a large serving platter. Top with the fried potatoes, crispy onions, and red bell peppers.
Enjoy!
