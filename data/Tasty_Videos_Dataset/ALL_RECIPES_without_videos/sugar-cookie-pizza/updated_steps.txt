Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Line a 10-inch (25-cm) cast iron pan with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, mix the butter with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until light and fluffy.
Add the granulated sugar, then the brown sugar, and mix until well incorporated.
Add the egg and stir until thoroughly incorporated.
Using a fine mesh sieve, sift the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt into the dough.
Combine with a spatula until evenly mixed.
Spread the cookie dough in an even layer in the prepared pan.
Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes, then bake for 15-18 minutes until lightly golden.
Let cool.
In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and remaining ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract until well incorporated.
Spread half of the frosting onto a quarter of the cooled cookie and the other half on the diagonally opposite corner.
Frost the other quarters with the chocolate hazelnut spread.
Decorate with your favorite toppings.
Enjoy!
