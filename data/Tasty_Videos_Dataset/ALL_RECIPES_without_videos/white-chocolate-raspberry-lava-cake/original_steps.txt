Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the raspberry jam for one minute.
Add the white chocolate and stir until smooth. Freeze one hour.
In a mixing bowl, add the white chocolate and hot melted butter. Mix to combine.
Add the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and flour, and whisk to combine thoroughly after each addition.
Coat the inside of the ramekins with butter and then add approximately one teaspoon of flour, moving it around so that it coats the inside completely. Discard excess flour.
Fill your ramekins about ¾ of the way with cake batter, then add a tablespoon of your raspberry mixture. Fill to the top with remaining batter.
Place the ramekins on a sheet pan and bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 15-18 minutes, until the lava cakes are no longer jiggly in the middle.
Run a knife along the edges of the ramekin to loosen and invert onto a plate.
Serve warm with ice cream.
Enjoy!
