Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Add the sweet potatoes, lemon slices, green beans, olive oil, rosemary, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper to a large bowl (or parchment paper-lined sheet tray) and toss until fully coated.
Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and paprika.
Transfer to a parchment paper-lined sheet tray and place the chicken breast on top of the vegetables (if you tossed your vegetables in a bowl).
Bake until vegetables are tender and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.
Enjoy!
