Preheat oven to 450°F/230°C.
Place pie crust in a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish.
With a fork, poke holes all around the bottom of the crust.
Bake crust in oven for 10-12 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine banana pudding mix and milk.
Whisk vigorously until thick, about 2 minutes.
Add two thirds of the whipped cream to the bowl and fold in until evenly mixed.
Remove the crust from the oven and allow to cool.
Add a layer of banana slices to cover the bottom of the crust.
Top the banana layer with the pudding and whipped cream mixture and chill for at least 3 hours.
Top chilled pie with remaining whipped cream.
Decorate with left-over banana slices.
Slice pie and serve.
Enjoy!
