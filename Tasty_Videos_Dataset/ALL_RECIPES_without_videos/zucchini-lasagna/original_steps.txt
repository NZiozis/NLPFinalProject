Cut the ends off of the zucchini, and cut in half, lengthwise.
Using a vegetable peeler, peel long strips of zucchini (these will be your “noodles”) and set on a baking sheet lined with paper towels.
Dab zucchini strips with a paper towel to absorb the excess moisture.
In a large pot, add olive oil, onions, and garlic. Cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes.
Add ground turkey, and cook for another 4-5 minutes, or until the turkey has browned slightly.
Pour in crushed tomatoes, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, tomato paste, and a bay leaf. Cover and let simmer for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, parmesan, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.
Using a baking dish, layer turkey sauce, zucchini strips, ricotta mixture, and parmesan. Repeat until there are 3 layers total, ending with the turkey sauce and topping that with parmesan cheese.
Bake for 50 minutes (times and temperatures may vary depending on the oven).
Let rest for at least 20 minutes.
Enjoy!
