In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, cheese, chicken, peppers, parsley, and barbecue sauce.
Transfer the mixture to a parchment paper-lined 9x9-inch (23x23-cm) square pan.
Spread the mixture evenly and freeze for 1 hour, or until firm.
Cut the block into 32 triangle poppers.
Pour the flour, eggs, and crushed nacho chips into 3 separate medium bowls.
Double bread the poppers by dipping them in the flour, egg wash, and nacho chips, then again in the egg wash and nacho chips.
Heat the oil in a large pot to 375°F (190°C).
Fry the poppers, four at a time, for 40 seconds, or until golden brown.
Sprinkle parsley on top of the poppers.
Serve with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.
Enjoy!
