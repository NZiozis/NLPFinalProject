Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Fold the parchment paper in half, then open up.
Quarter the potatoes and thinly slice the onion.
On one half, lay down the cut potatoes, drizzle on oil and sprinkle on salt & pepper.
Lay the chicken on the potatoes, season with salt and pepper and spread on the barbecue sauce.
Top with sliced onions.
Fold the parchment paper over the chicken, and cinch the paper together by folding it over itself along the edges.
Bake for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 165˚F (75˚C).
