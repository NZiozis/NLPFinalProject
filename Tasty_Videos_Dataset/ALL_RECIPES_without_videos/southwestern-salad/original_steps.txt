In a food processor, combine the avocado, lime juice, garlic, salt, and water. Pulse until smooth, then transfer to a large mason jar.
Add the bell pepper, corn, cherry tomatoes, quinoa, black beans, and spinach and screw on the lid.
Store in the refrigerator until ready to eat, up to 5 days.
Give the mason jar a good shake to mix and use a fork or spoon to stir as needed.
Enjoy!
