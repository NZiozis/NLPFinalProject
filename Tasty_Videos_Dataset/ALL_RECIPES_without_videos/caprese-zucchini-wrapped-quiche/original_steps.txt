Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
Trim the ends from the zucchini, then slice lengthwise with a vegetable peeler.
Line the muffin cups with the zucchini strips.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, tomato, milk, salt, and pepper.
Add a few pieces of mozzarella to each zucchini cup.
Divide the egg mixture evenly among the cups. Sprinkle the basil on top.
Bake for 18 minutes, until the edges are slightly browned.
Enjoy!
