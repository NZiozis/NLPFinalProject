Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a large bowl, combine the eggs, oil, pumpkin, honey, and water, and whisk until thoroughly combined.
Sprinkle the whole wheat flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, baking soda, and salt over the wet ingredients and fold until the batter is well combined.
Pour the batter into a greased loaf pan and smooth the top into an even layer.
Bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10 minutes before carefully unmolding.
Let the loaf sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour before slicing.
Enjoy!
