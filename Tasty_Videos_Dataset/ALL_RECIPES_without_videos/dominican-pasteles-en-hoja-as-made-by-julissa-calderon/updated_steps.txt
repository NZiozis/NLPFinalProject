Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the Bijol seasoning and cook for 3 minutes or until the oil turns reddish-orange and is aromatic.
Set aside all but 2 tablespoons of the seasoned oil and return the pan to the heat.
Add the red onion, garlic, beef, salt, pepper, and oregano and stir to combine.
Cook until the meat is well browned, around 15 minutes.
Add the tomato sauce and raisins.
Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low.
Simmer for 30 minutes, or until all of the liquid evaporates and the meat is tender.
Remove from the heat and let cool.
Make the plantain dough: In a deep bowl, add the plantains, yuatía, chicken broth cubes, Sazón Goya powder, lime juice, some of the milk, Bijol seasoning, and reserved Bijol oil.
Stir to combine, adding more milk as needed until the dough is seasoned to your taste, soft, tacky, and light orange in color.
Lay a banana leaf on a clean work surface and brush the center with Bijol oil.
Scoop 3 tablespoons of the plantain dough into the center of the square and top with 2 tablespoons of the beef filling.
Fold the banana leaf in half, then roll up and tuck in the ends to seal.
Tie tightly with twine to secure.
Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Bring a large pot of water to boil over medium heat and season with salt.
Add the pasteles, cover, and cook for 40 minutes.
Remove the pasteles from the pot.
Unwrap and serve with ketchup and hot sauce.
Enjoy!
