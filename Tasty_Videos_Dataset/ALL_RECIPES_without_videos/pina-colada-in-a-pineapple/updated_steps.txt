Using a pineapple corer, core the pineapple and slice the pineapple into chunks.
Place the pineapple chunks flat on a baking sheet and freeze solid, about 2 hours.
In a blender, add the frozen pineapple, coconut cream, coconut milk, white rum, ice, and lime juice.
Place the blender back in the freezer for 20 minutes or until thickened.
Blend one more time until fully incorporated.
Pour pi√±a colada back into the pineapple.
Top with a maraschino cherry.
Enjoy!
