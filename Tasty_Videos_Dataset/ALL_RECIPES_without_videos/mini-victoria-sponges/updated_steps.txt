Preheat oven to 160°C (325˚F).
Mix the flour, sugar, softened butter, baking powder, and eggs in a bowl until smooth, using a hand mixer.
Grease a muffin tin and fill each hole about ¾ of the way up with the cake mixture.
Bake for 25 minutes until golden and springy.
Allow to cool.
Cut sponges in half and spread jam on the bottom half.
Pipe a spot of whipped cream in the centre, then in a circle around that.
Place the top half back on and sprinkle with icing sugar.
Enjoy!
