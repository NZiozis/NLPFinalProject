Preheat the oven to 450ºF (232 ºC).
Roll out your pizza dough (homemade or store bought). Add olive oil.
Cover with whatever toppings you prefer.
Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your preference. We cooked it until the egg whites were cooked, but the egg yolks were still runny. But you do you.
Enjoy!
