Grate the green plantains into a large mixing bowl.
Add salt, pepper, and chili powder, and mix to combine.
Wrap one slice of cheese around a hot dog link and cut into fifths.
Take one tablespoon of your plantain mixture and encase one slice of the cheese-wrapped hot dog, shaping into a cylindrical “tot.”
Repeat until all slices are covered and shaped, and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze one hour.
In a large pot over medium-high heat, heat your oil to 375ºF (190ºC).
Drop four to five tots into the oil and fry until golden brown, about one to two minutes.
Place on a paper towel to drain excess oil.
Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce!
Enjoy!
