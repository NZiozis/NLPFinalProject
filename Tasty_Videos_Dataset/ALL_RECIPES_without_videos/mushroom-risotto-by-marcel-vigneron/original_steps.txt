Blend dried shiitake in blender until it becomes a fine powder.
Pour into a pot filled with filtered water, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep broth warm while preparing the risotto.
Sauté oyster mushrooms in grapeseed oil until brown edges have formed.
Add thyme, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of butter to help caramelize. Once they have caramelized, salt, to taste, and reserve.
Sweat the shallots in olive oil until tender, about 5 minutes, then add butter and sushi rice. Toast rice while stirring frequently.
Add bay leaf, garlic clove, and pour white wine over toasted rice and cook until the wine has been absorbed, then continue stirring.
Over medium heat, add 2 cups (470 ml) of warm mushroom stock at a time, stirring occasionally and adding more stock as it gets absorbed by the rice. The rice should absorb 6-8 cups (1.4-1.9 liters) of stock. Taste the rice throughout to make sure it cooks just until it is tender, or al dente.
Add frozen peas and stir. Salt the risotto, to taste, and remove the garlic clove and bay leaf.
Add ¼ cup (60g) butter, truffle oil, rayu oil, sautéed mushrooms (optional: save some for garnish), pine nuts, and Parmesan. Stir until well incorporated.
Garnish with reserved mushrooms, pine nuts, wood sorrel, Parmesan, and drizzle with olive oil.
Enjoy!
