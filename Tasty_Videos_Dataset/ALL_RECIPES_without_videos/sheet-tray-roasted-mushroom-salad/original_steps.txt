Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line 2 baking sheets with reusable baking mats or parchment paper.
Spread the cremini mushrooms in an even layer on 1 baking sheet and the shiitake mushrooms on the other. Drizzle ⅓ cup (80 ml) olive oil over the mushrooms, dividing evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss well to coat evenly.
Roast the mushrooms for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until crisp and tender. Remove from the oven and set aside. Leave the oven on.
Meanwhile, make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the mustard, honey, and lemon juice. Slowly drizzle in the remaining ½ cup (120 ml) olive oil, whisking constantly, until the dressing is emulsified and thickened. Season with salt to taste. Set aside.
Scatter the peas, shallot, garlic, and lemon zest over the baking sheets with the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Return the baking sheets to the oven for 5 minutes, until the peas are warmed through and the shallots are softened.
Sprinkle the roasted vegetables with parsley and set aside to cool slightly.
Place the arugula in a large serving bowl. Add the vegetables and half of the dressing and toss well. Top with the shaved Parmesan and serve with the remaining dressing on the side.
Enjoy!
