In a medium bowl, combine rice, bacon, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, 1 cup (115 g) bread crumbs, and eggs, and mix well.
Dip your hands into a bowl of water, then grab a handful of the rice and firmly press into a ball.
Coat the rice balls in the remaining bread crumbs.
Preheat oil in a pot to 350˚F (170˚C).
Fry the rice balls for 3 - 5 minutes or until golden brown.
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, sprinkle with salt.
We recommend serving with marinara sauce.
Enjoy!
