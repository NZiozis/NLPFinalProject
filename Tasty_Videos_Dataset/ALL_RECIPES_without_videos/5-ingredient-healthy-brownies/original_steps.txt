Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a small microwave-safe bowl, microwave the chocolate in 15 to 30-second intervals, stirring occasionally, until completely melted. Set aside.
While the chocolate cools a bit, beat the eggs thoroughly with a whisk until foamy and pale.
Pour in the honey and melted chocolate and whisk until fully combined.
Sprinkle in the whole wheat flour and salt. Fold the batter together with a spatula just until the flour disappears.
Pour the batter into a greased 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking tin and spread the top into an even layer.
Bake for 15 minutes, until the batter has just begun to set.
Let the brownies cool at least another 30 minutes before slicing and serving.
Enjoy!
