Bring a medium saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add the cashews and boil for 30 minutes, then drain.
Add the boiled cashews, basil, lemon juice, and salt to a blender. Start to blend, then slowly add the water while the blender is running until the “ricotta” reaches your desired consistency.
Serve immediately or store in the fridge for up to 4 days.
Enjoy!
