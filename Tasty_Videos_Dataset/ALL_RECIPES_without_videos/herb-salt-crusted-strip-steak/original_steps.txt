To make the herb salt, pour all ingredients into a food processes and pulse until desired consistency.
Let the steak rest at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to cooking. This will help the steak cook more evenly.
Season the steak liberally on both sides with the herb salt.
In a large cast-iron skillet, heat a drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Sear the steak for 4-5 minutes on each side, depending on thickness and your desired doneness. Sear on the sides for 1 minute each to crisp up the fat cap, if desired. For medium-rare steak, the internal temperature should read 135˚F (57˚C).
Let the steak rest for 10 minutes, then slice and serve.
Enjoy!
