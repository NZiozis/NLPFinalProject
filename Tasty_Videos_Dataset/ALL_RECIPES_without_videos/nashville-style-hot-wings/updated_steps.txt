Combine all master spice mix ingredients and separate into three equal portions.
In a large bowl combine chicken wings, ⅓ master spice mix, the buttermilk.
Cover and chill for as long as possible (4 hours to overnight).
Rinse the brined wing pieces and pat dry.
Mix the flour with another ⅓ of the master spice mix.
Dredge the chicken wing pieces in the flour/spice mixture.
Shake off any excess.
Set aside.
Heat your oil to 325˚F (170˚C).
Fry the wings for 8-10 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165˚F (74˚C).
The wings will splatter so its a good idea to have a lid nearby!
Take the wings out and drain on a paper bag or paper towels.
Place the lard in a saucepan and sprinkle over the last ⅓ of your master spice mix.
Once the lard is melted and warm, stir the mixture, and take it off the heat.
Immediately baste your fried wings with the lard/spice mix and serve right away!
Enjoy!
