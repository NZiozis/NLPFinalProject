Liberally season steak with salt and coarsely ground black pepper, being sure to generously coat the entire surface of the meat. Using your hands, press the seasoning into the meat create an even coating.
Heat vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add the steak to the pan and sear on one side for 4 minutes.
Turn and sear the other side for another 4 minutes, for medium-rare. If steak has a fat-cap, be sure to sear it as well for 30 seconds to a minute. Once cooked to desired doneness, transfer steak to a cutting board to rest.
Reduce heat to medium and add brandy. Allow brandy to cook down for about 1 minute while using a whisk to scrape off any browned bits leftover in the bottom of the pan.
Once brandy has reduced by half, add cream and continue to whisk until combined. Add dijon mustard and butter and continue to cook until mixture begins to reduce and thicken, about 5-7 minutes. The final pan sauce should have a rich consistency and coat the back of a spoon. Reduce heat to low and reserve.
Once rested, slice steak into Â½-inch (1.5cm) pieces. Pour cream sauce over the top and serve.
Enjoy!
