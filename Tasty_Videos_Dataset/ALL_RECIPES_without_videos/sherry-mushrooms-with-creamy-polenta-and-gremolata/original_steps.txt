Make the polenta: Bring salted water to boil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Pour in the polenta and stir for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to make sure the polenta isnâ€™t sticking or burning.
Right before serving, stir the milk, Parmesan, and butter into the polenta. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Meanwhile, make the mushrooms: Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and sweat until softened and slightly translucent, about 2 minutes.
Season with salt, then add the thyme leaves and mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms are caramelized and softened, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the sherry to deglaze the pan and stir to loosen any browned bits from the bottom. Cook off the alcohol, about 1 minute. Add the vegetable stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then let the liquid reduce for about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Make the gremolata: In a small bowl, combine the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest. Season with salt to taste.
Divide the hot polenta between serving bowls and top with the mushrooms and gremolata.
