Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes longer.
Drain the potatoes and press through a potato ricer into a large bowl. Set aside.
Heat the butter, cream, and milk in a small pot over low heat until simmering.
Pour the cream mixture over the potatoes and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Garnish with chives, if desired.
Note: A potato ricer gives these potatoes a super fluffy texture, but you can use a hand masher if you donâ€™t own one.
Enjoy!
