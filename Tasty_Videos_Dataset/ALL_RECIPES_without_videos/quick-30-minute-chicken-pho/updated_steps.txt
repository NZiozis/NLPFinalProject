Place the rice noodles in a large heatproof bowl.
Cover with warm water and soak for 20 minutes, until softened.
While the noodles are soaking, heat a large pot over medium-high heat.
Toast the black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and star anise pods for 2 minutes, until fragrant.
While the seeds are toasting, peel the ginger and cut into pieces.
Trim the ends off the green onions, then chop 5 inches off the bases and save the remaining green tops for later.
Add the ginger and green onion bases to the pot and cook for 2 minutes, or until fragrant.
Add the water, chicken broth, and chicken breasts.
Increase the heat to high, cover, and bring to a simmer.
Cook for 5 more minutes, then check the chicken every minute until cooked through.
Remove from the heat.
While the broth heats up, thinly slice the green onion tops.
Cut the lime into wedges.
Thinly slice the jalapeño.
After 20 minutes of soaking, drain the rice noodles, then return to the bowl.
Remove the chicken from the broth.
Strain the broth over the noodles.
Pour the noodles and broth back into the pot over high heat, then add the fish sauce.
Cover and cook for 3 minutes.
Shred the chicken.
Divide the noodles between four serving bowls and top with the shredded chicken, jalapeño, bean sprouts, and Thai basil.
Ladle the hot pho broth over the noodles.
Add a squeeze of lime, green onions, and any other favorite toppings.
