Heat a large skillet over medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes, or until translucent. Add the bell peppers and mushrooms and season with salt. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, then cover and cook for 5 minutes, until the peppers and mushrooms are softened.
Add the kale and cook until wilted. Remove the veggies from the pan and set aside. Wipe out the pan.
In a bowl, combine the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine. Set aside.
Heat another drizzle of olive oil in the clean pan. Add the eggs and cook until scrambled to your liking. Remove from the heat.
Lay a tortilla on a clean work surface. Add about ⅛ of the eggs and cooked vegetables, 2 ounces of beans, and ½ tablespoon each of the cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses to the center. Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll into a burrito. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Heat a clean skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the burritos on both sides, starting with the seam side, until the tortilla is brown and crisp.
Wrap the burritos individually in foil or reusable beeswax wraps. They will keep in the freezer for up to 3 weeks.
When ready to eat, unwrap a burrito and microwave for 3 minutes. Serve with salsa.
