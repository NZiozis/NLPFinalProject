Slice green pepper.
In a medium size bowl, combine Greek yogurt, dried parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, salt, dried basil, and green onions. Mix until well combined.
To prepare the platter, cut an assortment of your favorite vegetables into the shape they are easiest to dip with. (We used cauliflower, cucumber, green bell pepper, broccoli, celery, yellow bell pepper, carrots, red bell pepper, radishes, and cherry tomatoes.)
Surrounding a bowl, lay vegetables on top of a bed of kale and fill the bowl with the dip.
Optional: Sprinkle with some green onions, dried minced garlic, and dried minced onion.
Enjoy!
