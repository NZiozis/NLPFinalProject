Add all the burger ingredients, except for the feta, to a blender and blend until smooth.
(Make sure your chickpeas are very dry first!)
Divide mixture into four balls, then make an indent in the middle.
Place a small block of feta in each indent and roll up again until the feta is completely covered.
Fry in sunflower oil for 5 minutes until brown on each side.
Add to a burger bun with lettuce, tomato, salsa, and coriander.
Enjoy!
