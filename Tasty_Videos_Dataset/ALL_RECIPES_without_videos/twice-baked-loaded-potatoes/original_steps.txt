Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Rub each potato with 1 teaspoon of oil, and prick the top with a fork.
Place the potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 1 hour.
Transfer potatoes to a cutting board, and cut in half.
Using a spoon, gently scoop out the inside flesh of the potatoes and transfer to a medium bowl. Reserve the skins.
Add the sour cream, melted butter, salt, pepper, ½ of the shredded cheese, and ½ of the scallions, and combine with a hand mixer until smooth.
Use a spoon to transfer the potato mixture back into the scooped out potato skins.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Sprinkle the potatoes with remaining cheese, and bake for 5 more minutes, until the cheese is melted.
Top with sour cream, bacon, and the remaining scallions.
Enjoy!
