Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Using a sharp knife, make crosswise cuts in each potato, about ⅛ inch (3 mm) apart, stopping about ¼ inch (6 mm) from the bottom.
Microwave your potatoes for 5 minutes per potato.
Mix together melted butter, minced garlic, and minced parsley.
Brush on the potato. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
Insert 6-8 slices of bacon into the middle section of slots in the sliced potato.
Transfer the potatoes to the oven and bake until the outsides are browned and crisp, about 30 minutes, basting with more butter if needed.
In a sauce pan, combine the milk, cream cheese, salt, and pepper. Heat and stir until well-combined and smooth.
Add in the chopped chives to the cream cheese sauce.
Stir and pour over the crispy potatoes. Add extra chives for garnish.
Enjoy!
