Preheat oven to 400ºF.
In a bowl, toss cauliflower with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Spread in an even layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Roast for 20–25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until edges of the cauliflower start to brown and florets are tender.
Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a large bowl.
Slice hard-boiled eggs in half, then slice each half into 4 pieces.
Roughly chop the bacon slices.
Add the eggs and bacon to the bowl, along with cheddar cheese and scallions.
In a separate bowl, whisk dressing ingredients together until smooth.
Pour dressing over cauliflower and toss to coat everything well.
Garnish with extra sliced scallions before serving.
Enjoy!
