Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Mash bananas in a large bowl.
Add eggs and combine thoroughly.
Then mix together remaining wet ingredients: Greek yogurt, milk, maple syrup, and vanilla.
Next, add in dry ingredients and mix until fully incorporated.
Fold chocolate chips into the mixture.
Pour mixture into a greased muffin tin, filling each up about ⅔ full.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean from the center of the muffin.
Allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Enjoy!
