Preheat a grill or grill plate to medium heat.
Drizzle the corn with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix to ensure all the ears are evenly coated.
Place the corn on the grill. Close the lid to keep the temperature high, and let the corn cook for about 15 minutes per side, or until slightly charred on all sides.
Remove the corn from the heat and set aside.
In a small bowl mix the chili powder and cayenne together. In another small bowl, mix the lime juice and mayo together in a bowl, and spread or drizzle on the ears of corn.
Sprinkle the spices over the corn.
Top the corn with Cotija cheese.
Enjoy!
