Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a medium-size bowl mix together the beef, pork, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, garlic, eggs, salt, and pepper until just combined.
Take a walnut size of the meat mixture and roll into a ball.
Repeat with remaining meat and transfer to an oiled rack on a sheet tray.
Bake meatballs for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
Set aside.
Add oil to a pan on medium-high heat, and cook onions and garlic until they are deeply caramelized.
Add in the cider vinegar, ketchup, tomato paste, mustard, Worcestershire, honey, brown sugar, stir, and bring to a simmer.
About 5 minutes.
Add salt and pepper to taste (optional).
Add the cooked meatballs and coat them with the sauce.
Sprinkle with the fried onions, poke with toothpicks, and serve!
Enjoy!
