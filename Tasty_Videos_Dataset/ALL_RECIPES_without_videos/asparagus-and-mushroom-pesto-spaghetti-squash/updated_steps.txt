Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half.
If the squash is too tough, puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash.
Microwave for 3-5 minutes to soften.
Allow to cool before cutting in half.
Scoop out the seeds, brush with oil, and sprinkle with salt, and pepper.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a fork can easily pierce the skin.
Meanwhile, in a blender combine basil, olive oil, vegetarian Parmesan cheese, garlic, pine nuts, and salt.
Set aside.
In a pan add the olive oil and garlic over medium-high heat, sautè 30 seconds-1 minute, add in mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes.
Add asparagus and stir until cooked.
Remove squash from the oven, with a fork pull at the edges to produce that stringy “spaghetti” quality until you’ve completed both of them.
In the mushroom and asparagus pan combine “spaghetti” and pesto and mix.
Return to the squash and serve with or without plates.
Garnish with parmesan.
Enjoy!
