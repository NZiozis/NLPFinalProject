Preheat the oven to 200°F (93°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread ¾ cup (150 G) of sugar on the baking sheet, then bake for 7 minutes to warm. Remove the sugar from the oven and leave the oven on.
In a large clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric hand mixer on low speed until foamy, then add the salt. While beating, add the warm sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, gradually increasing the mixer speed, until thick and shiny peaks form, 5-7 minutes. Add the vanilla and fold in until just incorporated.
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Heap 10 equal scoops of meringue onto the baking sheets, spacing at least 1 inch (2 ½ cm) apart. Use the back of a spoon to create a divot in the center of each mound.
Bake for about 90 minutes, until the meringues lift cleanly off the parchment. Once done, turn off the oven and let the meringues cool in the oven for 2 hours, up to overnight. When removed from the oven, the meringues should sound hollow when tapped.
Meanwhile, make the strawberry puree: In a small saucepan, combine the thinly sliced strawberries, ¼ cup (50 G) sugar, and the lemon juice and let sit for 10 minutes to macerate, until some of the juices have released.
Transfer the pan to the stove and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, until the strawberries have slightly softened but are still vibrant red. Remove from heat and push through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any seeds. Let cool. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
To serve, heap ¼ cup (60 ml) whipped cream onto each meringue nest. Top with 1 heaping tablespoon pound cake cubes and 2 tablespoons quartered strawberries. Drizzle each with 2 tablespoons strawberry puree.
Enjoy!
