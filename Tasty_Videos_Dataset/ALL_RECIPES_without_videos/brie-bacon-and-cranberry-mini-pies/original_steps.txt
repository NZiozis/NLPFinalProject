Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Roll out the puff pastry sheets and cut out 8-centimeter circles for the pie base and 7-centimeter circles for the top.
In a greased muffin tin, place the pie bases in each hole, pressing them up against the sides.
Add the bacon, brie, and cranberry sauce, then use the egg wash on the sides of the bases.
Attach the pie tops, making sure they are properly sealed, pierce with a fork, and brush more egg wash on the top.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is risen and golden brown.
Enjoy!
