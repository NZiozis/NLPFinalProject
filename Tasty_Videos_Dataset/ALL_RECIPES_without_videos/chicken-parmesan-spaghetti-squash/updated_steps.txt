With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half.
(If the squash is too tough - puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash.
Microwave for 3-5 minutes to soften.
Allow to cool before cutting in half - following the dotted line).
Scoop out the seeds - brush with oil, salt, and pepper.
Roast face down in a preheated oven at 375˚F (190˚C) for 35-40 minutes (until a fork can easily pierce the skin).
Meanwhile - Slice the chicken breasts into strips.
Season with salt and pepper.
Place flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs into three separate bowls.
Coat each strip with flour, then egg, and then roll in bread crumbs.
Pour oil in a cast-iron skillet to come ¼ inch up the side.
Heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Fry the chicken strips (in batches if necessary) until golden brown on all sides and cooked through.
Transfer to paper towels and remove pan from heat.
Once the squash has finished roasting - remove from the oven and let it set for a few minutes before turing over and pulling at it with a fork.
Shred the inside of each squash, being careful not to poke through the skin.
Pour marinara sauce over shredded squash.
Top with chicken strips, then more marinara, and finish with mozzarella and parmesan cheese, and a pinch of Italian seasoning.
Return to the oven to bake for 10-15 minutes until the cheese has melted.
Enjoy!
