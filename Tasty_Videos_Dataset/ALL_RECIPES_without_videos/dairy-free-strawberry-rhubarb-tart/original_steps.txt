Make the crust: Add the whole wheat flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt, maple syrup, water, and coconut oil to a food processor. Pulse until crumbly.
Transfer the dough to the prepared pie dish. Using a flat-bottomed measuring cup, press the dough against the bottom and sides of the dish. Using your fingers, form the edges of the crust, then press all the way around using the tines of a fork. Work quickly, as the heat from your hands will begin to melt the coconut oil and make the crust hard to work with.
Transfer the crust to the refrigerator to chill while you make the filling.
Make the filling: In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the quartered strawberries, diced rhubarb, coconut sugar, water, and lemon zest. Stir and bring to gentle boil.
Add the cornstarch slurry and stir. Simmer until the filling thickens, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Remove the filling from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish.
Remove the crust from the refrigerator and poke holes in the bottom with a fork. Carefully pour the filling into the crust.
Decorate the top of the tart with sliced rhubarb and strawberries.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. You can cover the edges of the crust with foil to prevent burning, then remove the foil for the last 10 minutes in the oven, if desired.
Let cool, then slice and serve.
Enjoy!
