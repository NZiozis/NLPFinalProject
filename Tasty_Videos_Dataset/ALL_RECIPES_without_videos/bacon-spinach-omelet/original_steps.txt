In a 16 oz (475 ml) mason jar, add eggs, salt, pepper, bacon, spinach, and cheese. Place the lid on the mason jar and shake until ingredients are well-combined.
Remove lid and place microwave for 1Â½-2 minutes, or until omelet appears puffy. *Be careful mason jar will be hot*
Top with green onions, if desired.
Enjoy!
