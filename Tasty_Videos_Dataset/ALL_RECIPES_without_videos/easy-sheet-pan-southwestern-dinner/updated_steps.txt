Preheat the oven to 400°F (200˚C).
Place the zucchini, green and yellow bell peppers, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, corn, onion, black beans, and the minced garlic cloves on a baking sheet.
In a small bowl, combine the cumin, oregano, garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, chili powder, and cayenne powder.
Sprinkle the seasoning mix over the vegetables.
Add salt and 2 tablespoons of olive oil and toss with your hands until the vegetables are well-coated.
Place the red bell pepper halves, cut side down, on a second baking sheet.
Bake the seasoned vegetables for 35 minutes, stirring halfway through, until tender.
Bake the red bell peppers for 25 minutes, until soft.
Transfer the roasted red bell peppers to a medium bowl and cover it with a plate to let them sweat for about 10 minutes, until the peels are easily removed from the flesh.
Peel the red bell peppers.
Transfer the flesh from the red bell peppers into a blender or food processor.
Add the avocado, halved garlic cloves, remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, lemon juice, a pinch of salt and pepper, and the red pepper flakes.
Blend until smooth.
Remove the roasted vegetables from the oven and sprinkle with cilantro, if using.
Serve the roasted vegetables on corn tortillas with the sauce and sliced jalapeño, and lime wedges alongside.
Enjoy!
