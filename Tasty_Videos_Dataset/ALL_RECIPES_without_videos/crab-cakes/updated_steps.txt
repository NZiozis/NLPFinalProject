In a large bowl, whisk together the shallot, parsley, chives, egg, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne if using.
Add the crabmeat, season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.
Add the breadcrumbs and mix just to combine.
Form into 6 equal patties and place on a plate.
Chill in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes, up to 1 hour.
Coat the cakes lightly with flour, and shake off any excess.
In a large skillet set over medium heat, melt the butter.
Fry the crab cakes until golden and crisp, 3-4 minutes per side.
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain slightly
Serve warm with tartar sauce and lemon wedges.
Enjoy!
