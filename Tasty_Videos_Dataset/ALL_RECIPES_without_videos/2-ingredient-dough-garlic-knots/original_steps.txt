Preheat oven to 400°F(200°C).
In a large bowl, mix the self-rising flour and greek yogurt until it comes together to form a ball.
Transfer the dough ball to a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to begin flattening and shaping the rough into a roughly 8-inch (20 cm) disk.
Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into 8 equal pieces.
One at a time, roll each piece out into a roughly 12 inch (30 cm) log and set aside.
Transfer the dough logs to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and shape individual knots. Repeat with remaining logs.
In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, garlic, parsley, and salt.
Brush each knot with garlic oil mixture.
Bake for 20 minutes, until the garlic knots have begun to turn golden brown.
Enjoy!
