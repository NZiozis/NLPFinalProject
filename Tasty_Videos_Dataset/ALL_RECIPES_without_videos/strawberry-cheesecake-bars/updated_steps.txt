Microwave the marshmallows and cream cheese in a bowl, stirring every 15 seconds, until fully melted.
Add cereal into the bowl and mix until fully coated.
Let the mixture cool to room temperature.
Add dried strawberries and yogurt chips.
Mix just until combined.
Line a baking dish with parchment paper and pour the cooled mixture into the pan.
Press into the edges of the pan and top with more yogurt chips.
Cool in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Cut and serve.
Enjoy!
