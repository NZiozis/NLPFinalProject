Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Spread chili into a greased 11x7-inch (28 x 18 cm) glass baking dish.
Unroll the dough and cut into four even strips.
Cut the cheese sticks in half lengthwise.
Place a hot dog in the center of a piece of dough. Place each half of the cheese stick on either side of the hot dog.
Wrap the dough around the cheese and hot dog, overlapping slightly in the center. Repeat with remaining dough, hot dogs, and cheese.
Place the wrapped hot dogs on top of the chili.
Bake 15-20 minutes, until the dough is light golden.
Add the butter to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high until melted. Stir in the garlic powder and parsley.
Brush over the wrapped hot dogs.
Enjoy!
