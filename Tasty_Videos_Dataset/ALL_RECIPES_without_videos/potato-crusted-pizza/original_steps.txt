Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Thinly slice the potatoes using a mandoline and a hand guard.

Drain the potatoes through colander and transfer back into the bowl.
Add the salt, garlic powder, and black pepper, and mix thoroughly until fully coated.

Bake for 50 minutes.
Remove the parchment paper, baking sheet, and weight on top of the potatoes.
