In a food processor, pulse the cauliflower until it reaches your desired “rice” consistency.
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil, then add cauliflower rice and let cook for 5 minutes., stirring occasionally.
Add coconut milk, lime juice and lime zest, combine well and allow to cook until the liquid has evaporated.
Garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
