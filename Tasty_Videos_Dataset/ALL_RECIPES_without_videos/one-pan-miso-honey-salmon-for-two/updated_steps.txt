Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a small bowl, combine the miso paste, honey, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and pepper.
Whisk until smooth.
Place the salmon fillets skin-side down in the center of the prepared baking sheet and brush generously with the miso-honey sauce.
Lay the asparagus on one side of the salmon and the baby bok choy on the other side.
Drizzle the vegetables with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
Rub the vegetables until evenly coated.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked to your liking.
Divide the vegetables and salmon between serving plates, with rice alongside if desired.
Garnish the salmon with sesame seeds and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
