In a small pot, season the water with a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the rinsed rice and return to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to simmer, and cook for 20 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.
In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, salt, and rice vinegar. Microwave for 2 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves.
Transfer the cooked rice to a medium bowl and pour the vinegar mixture over it, then stir well using a wooden spoon.
Heat the canola oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the panko and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and remove from the heat.
In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise and Sriracha until smooth.
To assemble the bowls, divide the seasoned rice between 2 serving bowls. Top with the crab, crispy panko, cucumber, radish, nori, scallions, sesame seeds, pickled ginger, and avocado. Drizzle the Sriracha mayonnaise over the top.
Enjoy!
