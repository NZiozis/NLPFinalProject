Peel and chop the potatoes very finely.
Place in a bowl, cover with cold water, and leave until ready to fry.
To make the batter, mix the chickpea flour, turmeric, chili powder, pepper, salt bicarbonate of soda, chillies, and coriander.
Gradually add the water while whisking to form a smooth batter.
Heat a pot of oil to 160˚C (320°F).
Drain the potato slices and dip in the batter.
Fry in vegetable oil until golden brown (around 3-4 minutes).
Serve with spicy ketchup.
Enjoy!
