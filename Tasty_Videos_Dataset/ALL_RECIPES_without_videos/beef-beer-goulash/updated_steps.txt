Heat half of the butter in large pot or Dutch oven.
Add the beef, in batches, browning all sides of the meat.
Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper.
Transfer the beef to a bowl and set aside.
Clean the pot.
In the same pan, heat remaining butter, then add in the onion, celery, and carrot.
Cook until softened.
Add in the beer.
With a wooden spatula, scrape off the browned bits on the bottom of the pan to further flavour the stock.
Add in the seared beef, tomato pur√©e, bay leaves, juniper berries, and 2 teaspoons each of salt and pepper.
Bring the stew to a boil, cover, and simmer for 2-4 hours, until the beef becomes tender.
Serve topped with parsley.
Enjoy!
