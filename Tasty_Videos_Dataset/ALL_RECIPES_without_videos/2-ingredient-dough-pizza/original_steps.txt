Preheat oven to 400°F(200°C).
In a large bowl, mix the self-rising flour and Greek yogurt until it comes together to form a ball.
Transfer the dough ball to a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to begin flattening and shaping the rough into about a 12-inch (30 cm) round. If at any point the dough begins to stick, sprinkle on a bit more flour.
Carefully transfer the dough to a lightly floured baking sheet.
Spread the sauce evenly across the dough, sprinkle on the cheese, and top with pepperonis.
Bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the crust has turned golden-brown.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
