Preheat oven to 400º F (200º C).
Slice ½-inch (1 cm) off of the top and bottom of the butternut squash.
Slice the squash half lengthwise and scoop out seeds.
Drizzle the halves with the oil, salt, and pepper.
Roast for 40 minutes.
In a small pan or pot combine rice, oil, and vegetable broth and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce heat to simmer, cover with a lid, and cook for 18 minutes.
Add the garlic cloves, chopped tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, cumin, chili powder, and salt.
Stir to combine.
Transfer rice mixture to a bowl.
Scoop out half of the flesh from the roasted butternut squash into the bowl and stir.
Add the cheddar cheese and mix to combine.
Spoon the mixture back into the butternut squash halves and sprinkle a little more cheese on top.
Roast in the oven for 2-4 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
