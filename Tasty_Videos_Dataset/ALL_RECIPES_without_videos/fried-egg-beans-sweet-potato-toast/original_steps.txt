Cut sweet potato into thin slices, about Â¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
Place in toaster and set it to the maximum cook time. When it pops, flip the sweet potato slices over and toast 1 more time. Depending on the strength of your toaster and your preferences, you may need to toast it 1 more time after that.
Remove from toaster and let cool enough to handle.
Heat refried black beans.
Spread the beans evenly across sweet potato toast, followed by the salsa.
Top with a fried egg. Garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
