Preheat oven to 350°F(180°C).
In a mixing bowl blend, cream cheese, butter, and sugar until fully combined.
Add flour to cream cheese mixture and continue to blend together until fully combined.
Add crushed cookies to the mixture and gently fold together. Ensure the cheesecake batter is fully mixed.
Cover with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes, or until batter is firm to touch.
Roll batter into small balls and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.
Using your fingers or a warm spoon press down on the dough balls to help form a cookie shape.
Bake for 12-15 minutes or until cookies turn golden brown on the bottom.
Place cookies on a cooling rack and rest for at least 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
