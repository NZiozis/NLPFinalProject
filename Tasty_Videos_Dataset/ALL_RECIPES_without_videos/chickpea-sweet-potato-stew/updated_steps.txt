In large pot or Dutch oven, add the coconut oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions and cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until onions are semi-translucent.
Add in the garlic and ginger, and cook for 2-3 more minutes until fragrant.
Then add sweet paprika, cumin, coriander, and cayenne, and cook for 2 more minutes until fragrant.
Add in the chickpeas, sweet potatoes, crushed tomatoes, and vegetable broth, and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-high and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender.
Add in spinach and stir until wilted.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
