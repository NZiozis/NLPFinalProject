Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Cut the puff pastry into six rectangles and place on a nonstick baking tray.
On one rectangle, spread 1 tablespoon of pesto. Top with cooked spinach, 2 tomato slices, and mozzarella.
Place a rectangle of pastry on top and seal the edges with a fork. Repeat with remaining pastry rectangles.
Brush with egg wash.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is flaky and golden.
Enjoy!
