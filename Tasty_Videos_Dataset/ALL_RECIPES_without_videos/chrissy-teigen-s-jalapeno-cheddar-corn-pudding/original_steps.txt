Using food safe gloves, dice the jalapeños, and cut the kernels off of the ears of corn.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180 °C). Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking pan with butter.
In a large bowl, whisk the cornstarch into the heavy cream until smooth. Add 1½ cups (150 g) of cheddar, the creamed corn, fresh corn, jalapeños, melted butter, eggs, and salt and stir well. Taste and add more salt if necessary.
Pour the pudding into the baking pan and top with the remaining ½ cup cheddar.
Bake until set, 45-50 minutes. Fire up the broiler and broil until the top is browned, 1-2 minutes.
Enjoy!
