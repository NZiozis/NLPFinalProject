Mash bananas in a large bowl until smooth.
Mix in eggs until well combined, then mix in remaining ingredients.
Heat a skillet to medium and add in a scoop of the pancake batter.
Smooth out to form an even layer.
Cook for about 2-3 minutes until you start to see bubbles releasing from the top of the batter.
Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.
Garnish your pancakes with your favorite toppings! We used fresh strawberries and maple syrup.
Enjoy!
