Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Season the chicken thighs in a bowl with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, dried basil, and dried oregano. Mix until thoroughly coated with the seasoning.
On high, heat olive oil in a ovenproof pot and place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in the hot oil. Cook 3-4 minutes or until the thighs develop brown crispy skin, and flip over. Cook an additional 2-3 minutes to brown the other side, and remove from the pot.
Grate both zucchinis with a box grater.
Add the grated zucchini into the pot, along with rice, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and chicken broth. Bring to a boil.
Lay the chicken on top of the rice mixture and cover. Bake for 30 minutes or until the chicken’s internal temperature reads 165˚F (75˚C).
Remove chicken and broil 1-2 minutes to crisp skin even more (optional).
Serve chicken on bed of rice mixture.
Enjoy!
