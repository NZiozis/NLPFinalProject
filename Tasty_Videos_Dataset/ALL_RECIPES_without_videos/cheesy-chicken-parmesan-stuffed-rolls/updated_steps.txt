Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Carve out a deep hole in the center of the dinner rolls.
Press down the bottom of the bun to create a denser bottom layer.
Add olive oil, onion, and garlic to a skillet and cook for about 20 minutes or until caramelized and softened.
Add the oregano, basil, chili flakes, pepper, salt, marinara, chicken, and Parmesan cheese.
Cook until well-combined, reduced, thick, and heated through.
Put one thin slice of fresh mozzarella at the bottom of the dinner roll hole, fill with approximately ¼ cup of the chicken Parmesan mixture, and top with another slice of mozzarella cheese.
Bake rolls for 15 minutes or until the bread has darkened a little, the chicken mixture is bubbling, and the cheese melts.
Let cool slightly, sprinkle with chopped fresh basil, and serve.
Enjoy!
