In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-translucent.
Add the mushrooms and cook until most of the juices have evaporated.
With your spoon, make a space in the center of the pot.
Drizzle in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and add the garlic, thyme, pepper, and salt.
Cook for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.
Then, add the white wine and vegan Worcestershire sauce and stir until incorporated.
Add flour and stir until fully combined.
Then add the vegetable broth, almond milk, and pasta, and stir until well-combined.
Cover and increase the heat to medium-high.
Let cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the liquid is creamy and pasta is cooked.
Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.
Enjoy!
