Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a bit of oil, sauté onion, salt to taste, garlic, and bell peppers, until soft.
Combine chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cumin, garlic powder, dried oregano, salt, and pepper in a dish.
Use to season the flank steak on both sides.
Lay the steak flat on a cutting board with the grain running up and down.
Place sautéed onions and peppers in the middle of the steak, leaving an inch (2 ½ cm) or so on both ends.
Cover the onions and peppers with a layer of Monterey Jack cheese.
Tightly roll up the meat from left to right, ensuring that you will be cutting against the grain when you cut the meat.
Stick toothpicks through the sides of the roll to help them hold their shape.
Use a sharp knife to cut in between the toothpicks.
In a 4-quart jumbo cooker, cook over high heat until a nice crust has developed and flip.
Repeat with the other side.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until cooked to your preference.
Enjoy!
