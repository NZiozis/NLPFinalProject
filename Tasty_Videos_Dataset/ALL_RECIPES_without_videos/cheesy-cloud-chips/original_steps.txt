Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
In a bowl, whisk together egg whites, garlic powder, parsley, salt, and pepper.
Evenly distribute egg mixture in a greased mini muffin tin. The more mixture per muffin slot, the thicker the chip.
Top with shredded cheese.
Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until until cheese is melted and edges are slightly brown.
Cool for 10 minutes.
Remove chips using an offset spatula.
Enjoy!
