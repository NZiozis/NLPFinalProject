Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Slice into the chicken several times, about ½ cm (¼ inch) apart, but only cut about 85% of the way through, leaving the bottom intact.
Cook the spinach on a medium heat until it is slightly wilted, then add the artichoke.
Stir in the garlic powder and cream cheese, and cook for a minute or two.
Sprinkle over the mozzarella and stir until melted.
Allow to cool to the touch and then fill each segment of the chicken breast with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture.
Bake in the centre of the oven for 18-22 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear.
Enjoy!
