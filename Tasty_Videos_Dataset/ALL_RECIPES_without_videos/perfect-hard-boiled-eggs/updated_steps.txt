Place eggs in a pot.
Cover with cold water until the eggs are covered by about 1 inch of water.
Bring to a boil, uncovered.
Once boiling, take off the heat.
Cover and cook for 4-16 minutes, depending on preference (4-6 minutes for soft-boiled, 8-10 minutes for medium-boiled, 12-16 minutes for hard-boiled).
In the meantime, fill a large bowl with ice and cold water, creating an ice bath.
Once eggs reach desired cook-time, immediately remove the eggs from pot and place in the ice bath.
Allow eggs to cool for 10-15 minutes.
To peel, lightly tap the eggs on a flat surface, then gently roll back and forth (taking extra care with soft-boiled eggs).
Pull away the loosened shell and peel any remaining pieces.
Serve as is or incorporate into your favorite recipe that requires hard-boiled eggs.
Enjoy!
