Soak cashews in water for 30 minutes. Rinse, then drain in a colander.
Add cashews, coconut milk, maple syrup, water, dates, allspice, vanilla bean seeds, nutmeg, and rum (optional) to a blender. Blend until completely smooth.
Refrigerate the mixture until ready to enjoy. Refrigeration will thicken the veggnog. Add more water and blend again for a thinner consistency.
Serve chilled with nutmeg, and cinnamon stick.
Enjoy!
