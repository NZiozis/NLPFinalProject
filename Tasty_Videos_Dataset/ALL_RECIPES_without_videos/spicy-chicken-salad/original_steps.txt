In a medium-size pot, add the chicken breast, water, sake, sliced ginger, and scallions, and bring to a boil over high heat.
Once the water is boiling, flip the chicken breast over and put the lid on top of the pot. Turn off the heat and leave the pot sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Chill in the fridge.
In a small bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients and mix well.
On a plate, arrange the sliced tomatoes, julienned cucumbers, and sliced chicken breast.
Top with cilantro and drizzle with sauce.
Enjoy!
