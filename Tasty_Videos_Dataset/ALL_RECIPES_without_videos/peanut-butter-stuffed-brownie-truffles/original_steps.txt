Flip the prepared brownies onto a cutting board. Using a rolling pin, roll out the brownies to about Â¼-inch (6.5 mm thickness. Cut into 16 equal squares.
In a large bowl, combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and rice cereal. Mix well and freeze for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Form the peanut butter mixture into 16 equal balls, about 1 teaspoon each. (A melon baller works really well for this.) Wrap a brownie square around each peanut butter ball and roll around to seal.
Dip the wrapped truffles in the melted chocolate, covering the entire ball.
Using a spoon, drizzle warm peanut butter over the truffles and chill for 30 minutes, or until ready to serve.
Enjoy!
