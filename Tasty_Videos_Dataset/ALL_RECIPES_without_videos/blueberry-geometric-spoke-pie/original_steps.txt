In the bowl of a food processor, add the flour, sugar, and salt, and pulse 2-3 times.
Add the cold, cubed butter and pulse 8-10 times until the butter is pea-sized.
Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl, and gradually add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with your hands until the dough comes together.
Knead the dough on a work surface, and divide into two even discs. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator overnight.
Add 3½ cups (350 g) blueberries, sugar, salt, tapioca starch, and lemon juice to large bowl and stir to combine.
Remove one dough disc from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch (30-cm) circle, adding more flour to the dough as needed.
Place the rolled out dough in a 9-inch (23-cm) pie dish, trimming any excess dough to fit the dish.
Add the blueberry mixture to the pie dish.
Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Remove the other dough disc from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch (30-cm) circle, adding more flour to the dough as needed.
Using a ruler, cut the dough into ½-inch (1-cm) strips.
Place a 3-inch (7-cm) round metal cookie cutter in the center of the pie. Arrange the strips of dough around the cookie cutter, working your way around the pie. Trim any excess dough.
Remove the cookie cutter, fill in the center with the remaining blueberries, and chill the pie in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
Reduce the oven temperature to 375˚F (190˚F).
Continue baking for 40-45 minutes, until the crust is cooked through and the filling is bubbling.
Let the pie rest at room temperature for at least one hour.
Enjoy!
