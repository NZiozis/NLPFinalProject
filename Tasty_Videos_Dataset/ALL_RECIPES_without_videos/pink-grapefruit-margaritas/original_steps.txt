To make the simple syrup, bring the sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan. Wait until theyâ€™re completely combined, then set aside to cool.
Squeeze the juice out of all the grapefruits, and combine with the tequila and the simple syrup you just made.
Wet the rim of your glasses (you can do this with a slice of grapefruit), and dip in sugar. Serve over ice!
Enjoy!
