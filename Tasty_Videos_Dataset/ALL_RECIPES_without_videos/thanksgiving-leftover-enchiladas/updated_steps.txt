Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Place one tortilla on a work surface.
Place a small amount of each of your thanksgiving leftovers on the tortilla.
Fold the ends in, rotate the tortilla and roll upward, making sure none of the ingredients are coming out of the tortilla.
Place in a baking dish.
Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Once your baking dish is filled with “enchiladas” pour the gravy over the top.
Sprinkle the monterey jack over the “enchiladas.”
Bake for 30 minutes until golden and bubbling.
Sprinkle parsley over the “enchiladas.” Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
