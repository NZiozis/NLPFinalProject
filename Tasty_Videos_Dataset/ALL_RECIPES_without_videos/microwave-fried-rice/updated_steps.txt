In a bowl, combine the rice, water, soy sauce, sesame oil, and bacon.
Stir, then microwave, covered, for about 6-8 minutes until the rice is fully cooked.
Mix the frozen peas and carrots into the rice.
In a microwaveable mug, beat the eggs with the salt.
Microwave the eggs and the rice again for about 1-2 minutes, until the eggs are fully cooked.
Break up the egg into small bits, then mix it in with the rice.
Garnish with scallions, then serve!
Enjoy!
