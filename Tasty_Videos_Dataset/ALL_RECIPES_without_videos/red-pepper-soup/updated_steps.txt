In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a rolling boil, season with salt, and add the peppers.
Cover and cook for 6-7 minutes, until a knife easily pierces the peppers.
Use a slotted spoon to remove the peppers from the water and transfer to a blender.
Reserve the water.
Add peppers, pepper, and 1 cup (235 ml) of reserved pepper stock to the blender blend until a smooth consistency is reached.
Enjoy!
