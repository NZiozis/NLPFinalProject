Cut off the ends of the Cuban bread, then slice in half.
Add mustard, then ham, then pork, then cheese, then pickles, then place the bun on top.
Place the sandwich on pan or griddle over low heat.
Brush top with melted butter.
Press the sandwich with a panini press, or if you donâ€™t have a press use a heavy pot or pie dish and push down.
Cook 5-10 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
