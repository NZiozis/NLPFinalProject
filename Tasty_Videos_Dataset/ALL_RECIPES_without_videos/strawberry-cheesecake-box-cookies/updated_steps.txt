In a large bowl, combine the eggs and vegetable oil.
Add the cake mix and mix until smooth.
In a separate large bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.
Whisk until smooth.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using a medium ice cream scoop, scoop half of the strawberry cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet and flatten slightly with the back of the scoop.
With a small ice cream scoop, scoop the cream cheese mixture onto the middle of the strawberry cookies.
Scoop the remaining strawberry cookie dough with the medium scoop on top of the cream cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies easily releases from the parchment.
Serve warm!
Enjoy!
