Preheat the oven to 400°F (200ºC).
Trim the carrots, then slice on the diagonal into ½ inch thick coins.
Transfer the carrots to a baking sheet and add the oil, parsley, paprika, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the carrots are tender. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
