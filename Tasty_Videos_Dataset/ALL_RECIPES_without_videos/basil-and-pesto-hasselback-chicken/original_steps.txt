Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Slice into the chicken several times, about 1 cm (½ inch) apart, but only cut about 85% of the way through, leaving the bottom intact.
Cook the red pesto and basil on a medium heat until the basil is just wilted.
Sprinkle over the mozzarella and stir until melted.
Allow to cool to the touch, and then fill each segment of the chicken breast with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture.
Bake in the centre of the oven for 18-22 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear.
Enjoy!
