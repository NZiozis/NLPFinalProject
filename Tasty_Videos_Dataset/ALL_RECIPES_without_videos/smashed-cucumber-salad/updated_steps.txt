Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, smash the cucumbers, then slice into bite-size pieces and transfer to a large bowl.
Add the red onion, salt, and sugar, and toss to combine.
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.
Drizzle the dressing over the cucumbers, then toss to coat.
Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and red pepper flakes.
Enjoy!
