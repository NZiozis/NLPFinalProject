Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C) and pre-cook all ingredients except for the ground pork and bacon.
In a large bowl, season the ground pork with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and paprika. Add the egg and mix until just combined.
Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and place ⅔ of the ground pork mixture into the pan. Push down in the center and up the sides to make a well, making sure to keep the walls pretty thick. You don’t have to use the whole loaf pan.
Place the pork chop, halved breakfast sausage links, deli ham, breakfast sausage patties, pulled pork, and smoked sausage link inside the well.
Flatten the remaining ⅓ of the ground pork and place on top as a “lid”. Seal the edges well. Bake for 30 minutes.
On a large piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap, weave together the bacon strips until you have a bacon lattice twice as long and twice as wide as the pork loaf.
Place the pork loaf in the middle of the bacon weave and wrap the bacon around it. Tuck any excess bacon underneath the loaf.
Bake for another 30 minutes, or until the bacon is crispy. Let rest for 10 minutes before cutting.
Enjoy!
