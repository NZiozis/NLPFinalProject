In a large, nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Toss in the garlic and saut√© until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the shredded chicken, salt, sour cream, and lime juice.
Mix until the chicken is evenly coated and the mixture has heated through.
Stir in the cilantro and immediately remove from heat.
Pour the chicken mixture into a large serving bowl and toast the tortillas in the seasoned pan, about 3 minutes per side.
Divide the mixture evenly between tortillas, top with pico de gallo, and serve.
Enjoy!
