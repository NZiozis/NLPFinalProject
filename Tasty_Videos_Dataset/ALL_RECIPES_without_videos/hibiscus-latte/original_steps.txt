Steep the tea in the hot water for 5 minutes.
Froth the milk by adding it to a resealable jar. Shake vigorously until many bubbles form. Then, microwave the milk for 45 seconds to 1 minute, which will help create stable bubbles.
Remove the tea, then stir in the agave and frothed milk.
Dust the top with dried rose petals and hibiscus powder, if desired.
Enjoy!
