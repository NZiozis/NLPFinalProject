Make the ganache: In a medium bowl, combine the white chocolate and heavy cream. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each one, until the texture is silky and smooth.
Refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Place the pound cake on a cutting board and slice lengthwise into 4 equally thick pieces.
Set the bottom piece of the cake down first on a small baking pan or serving platter.
Spread an even layer of white chocolate ganache over the cake, then sprinkle with a layer of strawberries. Repeat making with the next two pieces of pound cake. Place the final piece of pound cake on top of the last strawberry layer and cover it with an even layer of white chocolate ganache. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Remove the cake from the refrigerator and place it on the edge of a cutting board sitting at the edge of your work surface. Use a serrated knife to cut the cake diagonally, lengthwise, creating two, right-angled pieces of cake. Use the edge of the cutting board to help guide your knife.
Set the two right-angled pieces next to each other to form a triangle with the final layer of ganache and base cake piece at the center. Cover with whipped cream.
Serve with strawberry topping.
Pairs well with ros√©.
Enjoy!
