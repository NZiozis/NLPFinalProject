Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a large bowl, prepare the cake batter.
Divide the batter evenly among a lined muffin tin, filling halfway.
Place a small ball of cookie dough on each, then top with remaining batter, filling about ¾ of the way up.
Bake for 20 minutes, then cool.
Pipe the frosting onto each cupcake, then top with chocolate chips.
Enjoy!
