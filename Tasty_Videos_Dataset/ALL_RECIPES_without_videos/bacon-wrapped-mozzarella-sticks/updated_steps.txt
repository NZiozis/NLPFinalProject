Freeze the string cheese (for at least a few hours)
Once frozen, place the string cheese on top of a slice of bacon, and fold the edges over to cover the cheese.
Once folded wrap/roll the cheese in a second slice of bacon.
Make sure to use toothpicks for support.
Pour oil into a pan and heat to 350°F (177°C), then place your Bacon Mozzarella stick into it.
Fry until the bacon appears to be cooked in it’s golden brown state then let dry on a paper towel.
Once dried, serve with a dipping sauce of your choice!
Enjoy!
