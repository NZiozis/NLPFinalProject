Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Cut pizza dough into 8 sections on a floured surface.
With one section, roll out dough until flat and circular.
Layer ham, swiss, pineapple, 1 tablespoon ricotta, and ½ tablespoon green onion.
Fold one side of dough up and over ingredients, and seal calzone by crimping the edges together.
Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Apply egg wash to outside of calzone and sprinkle with poppy seeds.
Bake calzones at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
