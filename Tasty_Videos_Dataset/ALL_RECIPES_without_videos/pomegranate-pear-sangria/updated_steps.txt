In a large pitcher, combine the pear, pomegranate seeds, simple syrup, pomegranate juice, brandy, and red wine.
Stir well, then chill until ready to serve, up to 2 days.
Immediately before serving, add the ginger beer, and stir to incorporate.
Pour into glasses and garnish with candied ginger.
Enjoy!
