Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Pit the cherries by placing them on top of an empty glass bottle, one at a time. Using a chopstick, push through the cherry to remove the pit. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the eggs and stir well to combine. Add the half-and-half and vanilla and whisk until smooth.
Melt the butter in an 8-inch (20 cm) cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, remove the pan from the heat.
Spread the cherries evenly in the pan. Pour the batter over the cherries.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the clafoutis is golden brown and firm to the touch.
Dust the powdered sugar on top.
Enjoy!
