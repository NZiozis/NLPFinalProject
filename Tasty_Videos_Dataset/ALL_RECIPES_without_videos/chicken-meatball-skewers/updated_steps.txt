In a medium pot, combine all ingredients for glaze and bring to a boil until the bubbles start to become sticky and glossy.
Combine the ground chicken, green onions, ginger, sesame oil, and ¼ cup (60 ml) of the soy glaze in a bowl until evenly mixed
If the mixture does not hold its shape when rolled into a ball, add in panko breadcrumbs, mix evenly, and re-roll the meatballs to test their structural integrity.
Roll about 1-inch (2 ½ cm) meatballs, then skewer 3-4 meatballs on a skewer.
Repeat with remaining mixture.
Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
Sear 3-4 skewers at a time and flip when the undersides are golden brown.
Brush the glaze on the skewers evenly and cook for about 5 more minutes, flipping every minute and brushing additional glaze as necessary.
Cool and serve!
Enjoy!
