In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond milk, vanilla, agave, and cacao powder until well combined. Add the chia seeds and whisk to incorporate.
Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to overnight, until the chia seeds have absorbed the liquid and the mixture has a pudding-like consistency.
Divide the pudding between 2 small bowls and top each serving with 1 tablespoon of almond butter and sea salt, coconut flakes, and raspberries to taste.
Enjoy!
