Crush 4 paçoca pieces in a bowl, then mix in the sweetened condensed milk to form a paste.
In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form, then fold in the paçoca mixture until evenly combined.
Transfer the cream mixture into a square baking dish, then crumble the remaining 4 paçoca over the top.
Spoon the Nutella over the mixture in large dollops, then taking a knife, swirl the Nutella and paçoca into the cream with a figure-8 motion.
Freeze for at least 4 hours.
Enjoy!
