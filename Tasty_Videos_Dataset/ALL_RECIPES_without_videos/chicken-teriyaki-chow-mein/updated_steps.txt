In a medium bowl, season the cubed chicken with salt and pepper.
Add ¼ cup (of 60 ml) teriyaki sauce and mix until the chicken is well-coated.
Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
In a wok or deep skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil, then add the par-cooked noodles.
Cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing the noodles to crisp, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
Transfer to a plate and set aside.
In the same wok, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, then add the chicken.
Cook for 3-4 minutes, until browned on one side, then stir and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until fully cooked through.
Set the chicken aside.
In the same wok, add 1 tablespoon of oil, the onion, and carrot.
Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.
Add the broccoli and cabbage.
Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes, then season with salt and pepper and cook for 3 minutes more, until the vegetables are soft.
Add the cooked chicken and crispy noodles back to the wok, along with the remaining ¼ cup (60 ml) teriyaki sauce.
Toss well and cook for 2-3 minutes, until everything is well-combined.
Garnish with sesame seeds.
Enjoy!
