In a bowl, mix the rice, salt, pepper, corn, onion, beans, tomatoes, and salsa.
Place the bell peppers hollowed side up into a 7-quart (6 Â½ liters) slow cooker. Cut the bottoms of the peppers if needed to help them stand up better.
Fill peppers halfway with rice mixture, then sprinkle on 1 cup of cheese.
Fill to the top with rice mixture, and top with the remaining cheese.
Pour chicken stock into the bottom of the slow cooker.
Cook on high for 4 hours.
Enjoy!
