Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C)
Cook the fusilli pasta according to box instructions.
This will make about 4½ cups (900g) of cooked pasta.
In a large bowl, mix together cooked pasta, corn, black beans, cooked chicken, alfredo sauce, and taco seasoning.
Pour into a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking pan and spread evenly around the pan.
Sprinkle Monterey Jack and cheddar cheese over the top and cover with foil.
Bake for 35 minutes, uncovering after 20 minutes to allow the cheese to brown.
Garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
