Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients except the baguette, and mix until smooth.
Slice the baguette in half lengthwise, then spread the butter mixture evenly on both sides of the baguette.
Place on a tray lined with parchment paper and bake for about 15 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and starting to brown on the edges.
Slice, cool, then serve.
Enjoy!
