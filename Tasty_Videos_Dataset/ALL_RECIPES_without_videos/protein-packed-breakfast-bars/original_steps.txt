Grease 2, 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking pans with nonstick spray. Transfer the bar mixtures to the pans, packing each mixture into half of a pan with a spoon or spatula.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the edges are slightly golden brown.
Remove the pans from the oven and let the bars cool for 20 minutes, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 5 days. Gently cut each flavor into 6 bars, then remove from the pans with a spatula.
Enjoy!
