In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-translucent.
Add the garlic, tomato paste, basil, and oregano, and cook for 2-3 more minutes, or until the onions are translucent and herbs are fragrant.
Add the crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, and lentils, and bring to a boil.
Increase heat to medium-high and cook for 10 minutes or until lentils are halfway tender.
Break apart the lasagna noodles into about 2-inch-long (5-cm) pieces and add to the pot.
Let the soup cook for another 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente and the lentils are tender.
Stir in the spinach and let wilt, then serve immediately.
Enjoy!
