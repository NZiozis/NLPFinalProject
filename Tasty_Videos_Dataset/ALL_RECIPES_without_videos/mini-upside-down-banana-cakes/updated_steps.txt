Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas.
Add the eggs, oil, sugar, and cinnamon, and mix thoroughly.
Add the flour and mix thoroughly.
In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, then mix the brown sugar until dissolved.
Increase heat and bring mixture to a boil.
Remove the saucepan from the heat, and divide caramel between the cups of a greased muffin tin.
Lay a banana slice in each cup, then fill cups ¾ full with banana batter.
Bake 20-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
Serve with vanilla ice cream.
Enjoy!
