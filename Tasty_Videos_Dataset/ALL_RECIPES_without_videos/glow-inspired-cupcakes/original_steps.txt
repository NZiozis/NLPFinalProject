Divide the cream cheese frosting evenly between 3 medium bowls. Add each food coloring to a bowl of frosting and mix well.
Set a sheet of plastic wrap on a flat surface and pour each frosting color into adjacent stripes. Fold the plastic wrap over the frosting and roll into a log shape. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Squeeze the frosting into a piping bag fitted with a star tip.
Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes.
Using a pastry brush, sprinkle edible glitter over the frosting.
Enjoy!
