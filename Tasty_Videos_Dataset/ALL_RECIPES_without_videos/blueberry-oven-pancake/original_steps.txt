Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F).
Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
In a smaller bowl, mix the milk, butter, and egg until combined. Whisk into the flour mix until a smooth batter is formed.
In an ovenproof pan, melt a tablespoon of butter and swirl around to grease. Pour in the batter, and scatter blueberries over evenly. Sprinkle over more sugar.
Bake for 25 minutes.
Serve with icing sugar, blueberry jam, and whipped cream.
Enjoy!
