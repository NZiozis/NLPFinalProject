Cook noodles according to package instructions.
Toss with 1 Tbsp. of sesame oil and set aside.
Pour ½ Tbsp. of sesame oil into your pot and add two lightly beaten eggs. When the eggs are finished cooking, set aside.
Pour another ½ Tbsp. of sesame oil into the pot and add 1 diced chicken breast. Set aside once chicken is fully cooked.
Add shallots to the pot (no need for sesame oil first - there should be enough moisture leftover from cooking the chicken) and cook until lightly browned and fragrant. Then, add your noodles, eggs, and chicken back into the pot.
Pour in pad thai sauce (use a pre-made mixture or make your own mixture of equal parts fish oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, and sriracha).
Top with bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, green onions, and cilantro, and stir until well blended.
Dish up and garnish with extra peanuts, green onions, and cilantro.
Enjoy!
