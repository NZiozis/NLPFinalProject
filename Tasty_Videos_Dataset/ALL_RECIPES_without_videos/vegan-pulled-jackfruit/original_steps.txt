Preheat your oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
Drain and rinse the jackfruit, then cut the jackfruit into smaller pieces, removing the core.
Add the olive oil, onions, garlic, salt, and pepper to a large frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté until the onions are tender and become translucent.
Add the jackfruit, chili powder, paprika, cumin, liquid smoke, salt, pepper, and liquid smoke, and stir.
Add the vegetable stock, cover, and cook another 10-15 minutes, until the jackfruit is soft enough that it can be mashed.
Mash the jackfruit with potato masher or a couple of forks, until it looks pulled or shredded.
Spread an even layer of pulled jackfruit across a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 25 minutes.
Remove from oven and pour over the vegan BBQ sauce and stir to combine.
Place back in the oven for 10 more minutes.
Build your burger, top with dressings of your choice.
Enjoy!
