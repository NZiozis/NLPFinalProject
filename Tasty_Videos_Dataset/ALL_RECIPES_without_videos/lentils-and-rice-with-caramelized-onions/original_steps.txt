In a large pot, saut√© the diced red onion and minced garlic in 1 tablespoon of olive oil until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add the water, green lentils, and salt to the large pot. Bring to a boil.
Cover with lid and simmer for 10 minutes.
To make the caramelized onions, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over low heat and add the onion slices, stirring occasionally until completely soft, dark brown, and caramelized.
NOTE: This will take about 30 minutes. The onions should become very dark and tacky when finished. Stir often to avoid burning.
Add the rice, cumin, cinnamon, and bayleaf to the lentils. Stir.
Cook covered for about 15 minutes, or until rice is cooked.
Serve lentils and rice topped with the caramelized onions, chopped fresh parsley, lemon wedges, and Greek yogurt if desired.
Enjoy!
