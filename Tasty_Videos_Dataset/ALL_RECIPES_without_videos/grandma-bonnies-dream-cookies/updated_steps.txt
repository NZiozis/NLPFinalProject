Preheat the oven to 275˚F (135˚C).
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baker’s ammonia.
In a separate medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer on low speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Add the vanilla and continue beating until fully combined.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat to incorporate.
Roll about 1 ounce of dough at a time in your hands to make walnut-sized balls.
They will be small, about ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) wide.
Place the balls of dough on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch (2 ½ cm) of space between each cookie.
Using a flat-bottomed measuring cup, gently press down on the cookies to flatten.
Top each cookie with 3 chocolate chips, a single almond, or raisins.
Bake the cookies for 30 minutes, or until the bottoms are light golden brown and the edges are crispy.
Enjoy!
