Sauté the bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, until crispy.
Add the sausage meat and red pepper flakes and sauté for about 10 minutes, until the meat is cooked through.
Remove from the pan and set aside.
In the same pot, sauté the onion over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, until translucent.
Add the garlic and sauté for 2 minutes, until fragrant.
Add the mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes, until they start to release some of their liquid.
Add the wine, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.
Cook for 7-8 minutes, until the wine has reduced by half and the mushrooms are tender.
Add the spaghetti and sausage mixture and toss to combine.
Add the Parmesan, pasta water, and spinach and stir.
Cook until the pasta is warmed through and the Parmesan has melted.
Enjoy!
