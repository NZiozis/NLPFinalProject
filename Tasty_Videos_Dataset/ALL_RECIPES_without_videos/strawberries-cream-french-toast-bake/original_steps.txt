Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Slice bread into bite-sized pieces.
In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg until fully combined.
In a separate bowl, mix the cream cheese and powdered sugar until smooth.
Whisk the egg mixture into the cream cheese mixture, and add the strawberries.
Spread the bread evenly along the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch (33x23 cm) glass baking dish then pour the mixture over the bread.
Bake 45 minutes or until bread is getting slightly crunchy and golden brown on top and edges. Top with whipped cream if desired.
Enjoy!
