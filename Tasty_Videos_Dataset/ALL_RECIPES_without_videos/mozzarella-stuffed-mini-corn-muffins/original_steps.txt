Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
In a large bowl, mix together the milk, eggs, and melted butter.
Fold in the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar, until blended.
Divide the cheese sticks into 5 cubes each so there are 25 cubes.
Spray a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray.
Spoon 2 tablespoons of mixture into each cup. Place 2 of the mozzarella cubes in the center of each cup, then cover the cover with additional batter, until the cup is ¾ full.
Bake for 15 minutes.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes while you eat the remaining cheese cube.
Enjoy!
