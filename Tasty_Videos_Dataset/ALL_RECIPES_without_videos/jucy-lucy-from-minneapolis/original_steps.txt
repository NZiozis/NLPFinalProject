Brush melted butter on the inside surfaces of the hamburger bun and place on a pan or griddle on low heat.
While the bun is toasting, flatten each beef patty so that it’s about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
Place the cheese in the middle of one of the patties, then cover it with the other patty.
Push the patties together and pinch the edges, assuring there are no holes for the cheese to seep through.
Place meat on a griddle or pan over medium high heat. Cook 5-10 minutes per side or until cheesy juices start spilling out.
Add pickles to the bottom half of the bun, followed by the onions. Then top it off with the cooked burger and top bun.
Get your chompers ready! But be careful - the cheese is super hot inside!
Enjoy!
