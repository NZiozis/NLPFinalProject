Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Cut the potatoes widthwise about ⅛ inch (8 mm) apart, and ¼ inch (6 mm) from the bottom.
Soak the potatoes in water for at least 15-20 minutes to remove some of the starch in the potatoes and to allow the cuts to open wider.
In a large bowl, mix together the cream cheese, 2 cups (200g) of cheddar, bacon, sour cream, and green onions.
Once finished soaking, dry the potatoes off and place them around the inner rim of a larger cast-iron skillet.
Heavily brush the potatoes with olive oil.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
Place the skillet in the oven for an hour, or until the potatoes are cooked through and crispy on the top.
Once finished, fill the middle of the skillet with the bacon cheddar dip.
Top with the remaining cheddar cheese.
Continue baking at 400˚F (200˚C) for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and golden brown .
Enjoy!
