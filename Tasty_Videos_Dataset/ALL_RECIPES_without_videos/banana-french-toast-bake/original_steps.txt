Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Over medium-high heat, melt butter and stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Bring to a simmer and add the sliced bananas.
In a large bowl, whisk 8 eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, heavy cream, and milk.
Add the cubes of French bread, and gently stir until the bread has soaked up all the liquid.
Pour the bread into a greased 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish. Top with the banana and sugar glaze.
Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden brown and slightly crispy around the edges and top. (Times and temperatures may vary based on oven).
Serve with powdered sugar on top.
Enjoy!
