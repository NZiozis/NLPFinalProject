Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a bowl, mash the cauliflower until slightly combined.
Add the egg, ¾ cup (90 g) bread crumbs, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley, and mix with a fork until combined. Chill for 10 minutes.
Form the mixture into nuggets with a cube of cheddar cheese in the center. Pack them tightly.
Roll each nugget in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs. Place on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.
Bake for 18-20 minutes, flipping the nuggets halfway through. Brush with oil for browner nuggets.
Enjoy!
