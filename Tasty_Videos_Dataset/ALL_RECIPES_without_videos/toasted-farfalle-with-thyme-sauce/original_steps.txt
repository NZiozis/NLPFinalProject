Preheat the oven to 350˚F (175˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Toast the pasta for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown.
Bring a large pot of water to boil over high level heat, and season with salt.
Add the toasted pasta to the water and cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until al dente.
Reserve ½ cup (50 g) of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta.
In a small skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the garlic, thyme, and pepper, and cook until fragrant.
Add the pasta to the sauce, along with the reserved water, and mix thoroughly to coat.
Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.
Enjoy!
