Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Using your hands or a pastry cutter, incorporate the butter into the dry ingredients, leaving large chunks.
Fold in the buttermilk until a thick dough forms.
Lightly flour a clean surface and dump the dough onto it.
Bring the dough together until it comes together in one large piece.
Roll out with a rolling pin to about 1 ½-2 inches (4-5 cm) thick.
Using a biscuit cutter or small glass, cut out 2-3-inch (5-7 cm) rounds and place them on the prepared baking sheet.
It’s okay if the biscuits are touching.
Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Brush the biscuits with melted butter.
Serve as desired.
Enjoy!
