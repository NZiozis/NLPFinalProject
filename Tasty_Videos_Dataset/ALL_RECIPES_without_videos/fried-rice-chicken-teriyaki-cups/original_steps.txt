Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
In a large bowl, combine the rice, onion, carrot, scallions, ginger, garlic, salt, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and eggs. Mix thoroughly.
Add ¼ cup (30 grams) of the rice mixture to each cup of the prepared muffin tin. Use your fingers to press the rice around the sides of the cups, making indentations in the center.
Bake for 35 minutes, until the cups have started to pull away from the pan and the edges are golden brown.
Meanwhile, make the teriyaki chicken: In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil, chicken, and salt. Cook until the chicken is no longer visibly pink, about 3 minutes.
Add the garlic and ginger and stir. Add the soy sauce, honey, sesame seeds, cornstarch, and lime juice. Cook the sauce until thickened, about 4 minutes, stirring often. Remove the pan from the heat.
Let rice cups cool slightly, then remove them from the muffin tin.
Place 3-4 pieces of chicken in each cup, spoon some sauce over the top, and garnish with chopped scallions.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
