Place shredded carrot and zucchini on a clean towel and wring out as much liquid as possible.
Place strained carrot and zucchini in a bowl and add ground beef, ground pork, parmesan, onion, parsley, salt, pepper, garlic powder, breadcrumbs, and eggs. Mix until just combined.
Grab about a ¼ cup (85 grams) of the mixture and roll into a ball.
Either pan-fry the meatballs over medium-high heat until all sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes, and pour marinara sauce into the pan. Simmer for 10-15 minutes. Or you can bake them on a piece of parchment paper at 250˚F (180˚C) for 30-35 minutes, flipping after the first 15 minutes. Warm up marinara sauce on the side.
Serve with cooked spaghetti and parmesan cheese.
Enjoy!
