Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out the puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface to a 9x12-inch (23x30 cm) rectangles.
Spread the pesto sauce over the sheets using a spatula or spoon.
Top with the shredded chicken, Parmesan, and salt.
Starting from a short end, carefully roll up the puff pastry to form logs.
Slice the logs into ½-inch (1 cm) rounds and arrange them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch (2 cm) apart.
Brush with egg wash.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Sprinkle with chopped parsley, then serve.
Enjoy!
