Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Carefully slice sweet potatoes into ⅛ inch (3 mm) slices. Add to a large mixing bowl.
Add melted butter, coconut oil, cumin, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes. Toss to coat potato slices.
Mix in the Parmesan cheese.
In a greased cupcake tin, stack the sweet potato chips to fill each cup.
Bake in preheated oven for 50-55 minutes until tops and edges nicely brown.
Remove from oven and top each stack with a marshmallow.
Return to oven for 3-5 minutes, watching carefully, until the marshmallows are light brown and have puffed up. Alternatively, broil for 30 seconds.
Remove from oven. Carefully pat down each marshmallow to form a nice dome over the stack.
Let cool slightly before removing from pan.
Enjoy!
