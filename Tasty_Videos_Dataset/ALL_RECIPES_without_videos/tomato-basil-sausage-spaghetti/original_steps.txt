Heat pot to medium-high heat.
Cook the sausage in the pot.
Add the onions, salt, and pepper, cooking until the onions are translucent and sausage is starting to brown.
Add the marinara, milk, and basil, cooking until sauce has thickened slightly.
Add the spaghetti, and toss until evenly coated and sauce sticks to the noodles.
Enjoy!
