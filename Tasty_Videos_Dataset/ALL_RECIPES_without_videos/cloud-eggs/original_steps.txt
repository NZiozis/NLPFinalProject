Preheat the oven to 230°C (450°F).
Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Save the yolks for later.
Place the egg whites in a large bowl. Using an electric hand whisk, whisk on a high speed until soft peaks form.
Fold in salt and pepper.
Spoon the egg whites onto a baking tray and make a well in the middle, for the yolks to go in later.
Bake for 8-10 minutes.
Drop the yolks into the whites and bake for a further 3 minutes.
Serve on toast or with sides of your choice.
Enjoy!
