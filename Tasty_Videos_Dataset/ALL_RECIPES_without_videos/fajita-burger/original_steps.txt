In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, garlic powder, parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika.
In a ramekin, spread two-thirds of the beef patty evenly along the bottom and sides.
Place the red pepper, pepper jack, and green pepper into the well.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Place the rest of the beef patty on top and pat to flatten.
Place the ramekin on a baking sheet along with the sesame bun, face down.
Bake for 25 minutes.

Enjoy!
