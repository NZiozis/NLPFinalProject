Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Spread the almonds on one half of the baking sheet and the walnuts on the other half.
Toast for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant. Let cool 20 minutes before roughly chopping.
In a food processor or blender, combine the dates, salt, and water, and process until well-combined.
Transfer the date mixture to a large bowl and add the brown rice cereal, oats, blueberries, cinnamon, and salt. Stir until well-combined. Add the chopped nuts and fold to combine.
Transfer the mixture to a parchment-lined baking sheet and spread flat with a spatula.
Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 30-45 minutes to set.
In a large bowl, combine the chocolate and coconut oil, and microwave for 1½ minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted and smooth
Pour ⅔ of the melted chocolate over the bars and spread evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 10 minutes, or until the chocolate is set.
Invert the bars onto a cutting board and remove the parchment paper. Drizzle the remaining chocolate over the top. Return to the freezer for 10 minutes, until the chocolate is set.
Cut into 16 bars. Wrap individually in parchment paper and store in the fridge or freezer until ready to eat.
Enjoy!
