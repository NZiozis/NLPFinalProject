Make the sweet chili sauce: In a small pot over medium heat, mix together ½ cup (120 ml) of water, the garlic, Fresno chilies, sugar, rice vinegar, and salt.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and remaining tablespoon of water.
Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the sauce until fully incorporated.
Continue to simmer for 1 minute, or until the mixture has thickened.
Remove from the heat and let cool.
Make the lumpia: Julienne the carrots.
Cut the green beans on the diagonal.
In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes or until slightly tender.
Add the garlic and ginger, and continue cooking for 2 minutes more, until fragrant.
Add the carrots and green beans, and toss to combine.
Add the shrimp, fish sauce, salt, pepper, and rice vinegar, and cook for 2 minutes or until shrimp is pink.
Add the bean sprouts, toss to incorporate, and remove the pan from the heat.
Lay out a lumpia wrapper in a diamond shape and spoon 2 tablespoons of filling onto the bottom of the wrapper, leaving about 1½ inches (4 cm) of space from the bottom point.
Fold the bottom point over the filling, then fold in the edges to create an envelope shape.
Roll the wrapper toward the top point.
Brush the top point with egg wash and finish the roll to seal the end.
Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.
In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 inch (2.5 cm) of canola oil to 300°F (150°C).
Carefully add 4-5 lumpia at a time to the hot oil.
Fry on each side for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.
Note: If the lumpia are cooking too quickly or burning, reduce the heat.
Remove the lumpia from the oil and drain on a wire rack or paper towels.
Garnish with cilantro and serve with the sweet chili sauce.
Enjoy!
