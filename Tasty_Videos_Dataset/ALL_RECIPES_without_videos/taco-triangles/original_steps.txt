In a large pan over medium heat, add the olive oil, onion, red and green bell pepper, salt, pepper, paprika, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and dried oregano. Mix to combine.
Add the lime juice and cook the vegetables until soft, about 5 minutes.
Seperate the vegetables in three medium bowls.
To one bowl, add the shredded chicken. To another bowl, add the black beans. To the last bowl, add the ground beef.
Stir each bowl until everything is incorporated.
Cut a tortilla in half with a pizza cutter or knife.
Put a spoonful of one of the fillings in the center of the tortilla half and sprinkle with cheese.
Fold each corner over the middle, forming a triangle.
Flip the tortilla triangle over so the seam is down.
Brush the edge of the tortilla with egg wash and press with a fork to seal.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings.
In a deep pan, heat two inches of oil to 350°F (180°C).
Once the oil is hot, place 2-3 tortilla triangles in the pan and cook on each side for 3 minutes, or until golden brown.
Drain the triangles on a rack
Serve with cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.
Enjoy!
