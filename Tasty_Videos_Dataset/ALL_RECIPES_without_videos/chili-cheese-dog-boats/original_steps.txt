Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C.
Place the 8 hot dog buns in a 9x13 inch (22x33 cm) baking dish, then cut a rectangle in each hot dog bun, making sure to stay 1 centimeter from the edges.
Push down on the bread cut-out and compact this portion of the bun tightly into the bottom of each bun, making sure to press down on the bottom edges as well. This will help create a larger space for the fillings and reduce mess.
Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl, then brush the buns and their hollowed insides with the garlic butter. Bake for 5 minutes to toast the buns as well as help the sides of the buns firm up so they don’t collapse under the weight of the fillings.
Place a slice of cheddar cheese inside each bun, then spoon a bit of chili inside each one.
Slide the hot dog snugly on top of the chili, then top with more chili.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and the chili has started to brown.
Top with fresh parsley, then slice the hot dogs boats along their connected seams to serve.
Enjoy!
