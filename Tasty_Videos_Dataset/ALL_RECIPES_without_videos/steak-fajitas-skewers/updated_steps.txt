Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
Combine the steak, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl and mix until the steak is evenly coated.
Slide a piece of steak down a skewer, followed by a piece of green pepper, red pepper, and onion.
Continue until there is a 1-inch gap on the top of the skewer.
Repeat with the remaining skewers.
Grease the surface of the grill by rubbing the grates with an oiled paper towel (use tongs to grip!
).
Grill the skewers for 10-15 minutes with the lid closed, flipping them halfway through.
Enjoy!
