Transfer the sautéed vegetables to a bowl and set aside.
Melt the vegan butter in the pan.
Add the mushrooms and stir to coat in the butter.
Add the paprika, ¼ teaspoon onion powder, ¼ teaspoon garlic powder, ½ teaspoon black pepper, and ½ teaspoon salt. Stir well. Sauté for about 7 minutes until the mushrooms are dark brown and reduce in size by half.

In the meantime, place the carrot, vegetable broth, remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon juice, nutritional yeast, remaining teaspoon of onion powder, remaining teaspoon of garlic powder, the tomato paste, remaining ½ teaspoon of salt, and remaining ½ teaspoon of pepper in a food processor. Blend until it forms a smooth and homogenous sauce.
