Preheat oven to 350˚F (180°C).
Roll out a sheet of puff pastry and spread the pesto evenly over it, leaving a small amount of room at the edges.
Sprinkle over the mozzarella and place another sheet of puff pastry on top, making a sandwich.
Cut into thin strips with a sharp knife.
Grab both ends of each strip, press down firmly to seal the edges and twist.
Transfer onto a baking tray lined with baking paper, and brush with beaten egg.
Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle over the parmesan.
Bake for 25 minutes until golden brown.
Enjoy!
