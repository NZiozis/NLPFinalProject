Place the apple peels and cores (optional) in a quart-sized jar with a wide mouth.
Cover the peels completely with the water.
Add the sugar and stir.
Make sure your scraps are completely covered with water.
Cover the mouth of the jar with a coffee filter or a thin cloth, then screw on the outer ring of the lid.
Let sit in a dark area at room temperature for 1-2 weeks, stirring the mix once a day to stimulate proper fermentation and prevent mold from forming.
When you notice some fizz and a significant amount of bubbles on the surface, strain out the scraps and compost them.
Put the liquid back in the jar, cover with a coffee filter or a thin cloth, and let it sit.
Taste it once a week and once it has reached your desired level acidity, cover with a lid or transfer to a closed bottle to stop the fermentation.
The apple cider vinegar will keep for about a year in the refrigerator.
Enjoy!
