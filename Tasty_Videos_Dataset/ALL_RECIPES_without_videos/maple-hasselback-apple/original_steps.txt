Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Peel the apple and cut in half. Using a melon baller, carve out the core of the apple halves.
Using a sharp knife, make vertical incisions into the apple, about a quarter of an inch apart, without cutting all the way through the apple halves. (You can use a set of chopsticks as safety bumpers to make sure that your knife can’t cut all the way through.)
In a small bowl, mix together the maple syrup, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Use a pastry brush to coat the apple halves with the maple spice mixture.
Bake for 30 minutes until the apples are tender and lightly browned.
Top each apple half with a small scoop of frozen yogurt and a sprinkle of chopped almonds and serve.
Enjoy!
