Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
Use your hands to crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. Add the soy sauce, tomato sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, pepper, and cayenne and stir until well-combined.
Add a drizzle of olive oil to a large baking sheet. Transfer the tofu to the baking sheet, using a spatula to spread it out as much as possible.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until golden brown and slightly crispy.
Fill the tortillas with the tofu, lettuce, tomato, shredded cheese, and guacamole.
Enjoy!
