Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Place all the vegetable skins on a nonstick baking sheet or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Drizzle the olive oil over the peels and sprinkle with the garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper.
Toss the peels with your hands until they are evenly coated with the oil and spices.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, tossing the peels halfway through with a pair of tongs.
Let cool before eating.
Enjoy!
