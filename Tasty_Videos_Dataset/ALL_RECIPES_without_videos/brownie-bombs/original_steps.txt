Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
In a large bowl, combine the oil, melted butter, sugar, and cocoa powder and whisk.
Add the egg and vanilla and mix until the ingredients are incorporated.
Add the flour mixture, and mix thoroughly with a spatula.
Roll the dough into 2-inch (5-cm) balls. Press a truffle into each dough ball and wrap the dough around so the truffle is not exposed. Place onto a parchment paper covered baking pan.
Bake for 10 minutes, until the dough is slightly firm to the touch.
Dust with powdered sugar. Can be stored in an airtight container up to 5 days. Reheat in the microwave for 20 seconds before eating.
Enjoy!
