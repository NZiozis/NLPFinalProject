In a large bowl, add butter and marshmallow.
Microwave for 2 minutes.
Stir at 1 minute.
Add the cereal and stir until the marshmallow evenly coats the cereal.
Using a ice cream scoop, form treats into balls.
Take a wafer cone and dip it in melted chocolate and then immediately sprinkle anything you desire.
Place the rice krispy balls into the cone.
Enjoy!
