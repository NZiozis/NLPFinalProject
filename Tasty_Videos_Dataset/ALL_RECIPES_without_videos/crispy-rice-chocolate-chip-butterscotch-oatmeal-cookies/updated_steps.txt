Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
In a large bowl, whisk together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth.
Add the egg and vanilla, then whisk until well combined.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, using a rubber spatula to incorporate.
Do not overmix.
Fold in the rice cereal, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and oats.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Scoop 1-tablespoon-sized balls of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
Let cool on baking sheet for 1 minute before transferring to a wire rack.
Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if desired.
Enjoy!
