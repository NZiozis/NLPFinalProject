Halve the limes, then juice using a citrus press or a pair of kitchen tongs.
You should have about 1 cup (240 ML) total.
In a medium bowl, combine the shrimp, lime juice, salt, jalape√±os, onion, and tomatoes.
Mix well.
Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours, until the shrimp is opaque and firm.
Serve the ceviche chilled.
Garnish with cilantro, if desired, and serve with tortilla chips.
Enjoy!
