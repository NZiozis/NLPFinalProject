Preheat oven to 170˚F (70˚C).
In a food processor or blender, puree strawberries, kiwi, sugar, and lemon juice.
Over a bowl or jug, pour the puree into a strainer and stir to remove most of the seeds.
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pour the puree and spread evenly over the paper, being careful not to let it spill over the edges.
Bake for 5 hours, or until it is mostly dehydrated and is no longer sticky.
(This may take up to 6 hours depending on the oven.) It is done when it has a bendable, leathery texture.
Cool completely and cut into strips, leaving the parchment paper attached.
Roll each strip up and tie with a ribbon or twine.
To serve, remove ribbon/twine and parchment paper.
Enjoy!
