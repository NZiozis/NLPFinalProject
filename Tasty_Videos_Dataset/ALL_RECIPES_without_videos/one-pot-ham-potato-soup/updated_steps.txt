In a 6-quart (5.7 liters) dutch oven, cook bacon over medium-high heat until fat is rendered out and the pieces begin to get crispy.
Add onion, carrot, and celery, and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and add flour, stirring constantly for 1-2 minutes to avoid lumps.
Add ham, potatoes, thyme, and black pepper.
Stir to coat the meat and potatoes in the roux/vegetable mix.
Add the chicken broth and bay leaves.
Cover and bring to a boil.
Then reduce heat to medium-low and cook covered for 25-30 minutes.
Remove bay leaves and stir in cream.
Return to a simmer and serve.
Enjoy!
