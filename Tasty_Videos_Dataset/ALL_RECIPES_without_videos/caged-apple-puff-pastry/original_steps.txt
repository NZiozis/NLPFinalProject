Cut the puff pastry into 9 equal squares.
Taking one of the squares, make 5 equal 1-inch (2 cm) cuts on 2 sides of the square.
Make 3 vertical 1-inch (2 cm) cuts in between the edge of the uncut side and the 2 slits on the cut sides.
Make 2 vertical 1-inch (2 cm) cuts under the top slit and above the bottom slit.
Repeat this pattern until you have 6 rows with 3 cuts and 5 rows with slits and 2 cuts. Set aside

Take another square place one of the apple halves in the center, peeled side facing up. Brush egg wash on each side of the square around the apple.
Combine the butter, cinnamon and sugar in a bowl. Brush over the apple until it is completely coated.
Take the other cut square of dough and stretch it over the apple, your cut should look like holes in the dough.
Pinch the bottom of the dough together until it is sealed.
