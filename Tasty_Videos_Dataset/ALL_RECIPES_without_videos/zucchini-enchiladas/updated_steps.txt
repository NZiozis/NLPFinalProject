Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a pan over medium heat, add the oil and the onions and cook until the onions are translucent.
Add the garlic and stir to combine.
Add the black beans, corn, 1 cup (290 g) of enchilada sauce, lime juice, salt, cumin, and chili powder, and stir until combined.
Cook until just simmering.
Set aside.
Cut off the end of each zucchini then using a vegetable peeler, peel each zucchini into wide strips.
Place 4-5 zucchini strips on a plate and spoon a large spoonful of filling at the bottom of the strips.
Fold the ends of the zucchini over the filling and continue to roll, tightly.
Transfer the zucchini rolls to a baking dish.
Spoon over the remaining enchilada sauce and top with cheese.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Serve with sour cream and cilantro.
Enjoy!
