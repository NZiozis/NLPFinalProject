To make the crust, blend together the cookie sandwiches and the vegan butter in a food processor. Blend for 10 seconds at a time until the cookies have absorbed all the butter. The mix should stick when pressed together.
Transfer to a greased pie pan, press to form a crust.
Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
To make the filling, place your dates in a bowl and soak them in the boiling water for 10-15 minutes.
Transfer the dates and the water to a food processor and blend for 10 seconds at a time until a thick paste has formed. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Add the rest of the ingredients for the filling into the mixing bowl and fold them into the paste. Mix thoroughly.
Pour the mix into the chilled pie crust. Bake in the oven at 350° F (180° C) for 40-45 minutes. The texture should be thick and fudgy.
Enjoy!
