Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine the chicken wings, olive oil, corn starch, pepper, and salt and toss with tongs to coat.
Transfer the wings to the baking sheet. Bake for 40 minutes, until golden and crispy.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
