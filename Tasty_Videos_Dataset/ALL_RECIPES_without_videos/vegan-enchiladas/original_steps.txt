In a medium saucepan, whisk together oil and flour over low heat. Add spices and mix together.
Slowly add the veggie broth and chili powder while whisking continuously. Let simmer for a few minutes until it begins to thicken slightly.
In a separate pot, lightly sauté the onion and peppers for a few minutes, before adding the zucchini, and finally the black beans. Season with pepper and a pinch of salt.
Soften the corn tortillas by wrapping in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 10 seconds.
Next, spread some of the sauce over the tortilla, and add the filling. Roll and place lined up in a baking dish. Pour the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas. Sprinkle with olives and green onions.
Cover with foil and bake at 350˚ (177˚C) for 20 minutes.
Soak cashews in hot water for 10 minutes (microwave works) add salt and lemon juice. Blend until creamy.
Serve with avocado, cilantro, and a dollop of non-dairy sour cream.
Enjoy!
