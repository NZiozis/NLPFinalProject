Peel and roughly dice the apples, removing the cores.
Add the apples to a slow cooker with the water, salt, and cinnamon sticks, and stir to combine. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours, stirring halfway through.
Uncover and remove the cinnamon sticks. Using an immersion blender, blend until your desired consistency is reached.
Scoop out half of the applesauce and enjoy immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 10 days.
To the remaining applesauce, add the brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and stir to combine. Cover and cook for 3 hours on high or 6 hours on low, stirring halfway through.
Enjoy!
