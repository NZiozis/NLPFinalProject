Place cookies in a gallon sized plastic bag and hit with a rolling pin or pan until crushed.
Pat the cookie crumbs into the bottom of a 9‚Äù (23 cm) pie dish.
Spread the softened ice cream on top and smooth out.
Drizzle the top with melted chocolate.
Freeze for 4 hours, or until the ice cream is hardened.
Enjoy!
