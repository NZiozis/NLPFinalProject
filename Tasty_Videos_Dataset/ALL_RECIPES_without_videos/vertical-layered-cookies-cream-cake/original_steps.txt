Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks with 1 cup (200 g) of sugar and the vanilla extract until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Sift in the flour, half of the cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Mix until just combined, and set aside
In a separate large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the remaining sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.
Beat a third of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites.
Divide the batter between the two baking sheets. Spread evenly and bake for 10-12 minutes. Let cool at room temperature until the pans are cool to touch.
Dust the tops of the cakes with the remaining cocoa powder. Cover with parchment paper, and flip the cakes over to remove from the pans.
Carefully peel away the baked parchment paper and discard. Cut each cake in half vertically, then set aside.
In a large bowl, whip the cream cheese and butter until fluffy. Gradually incorporate the powdered sugar, then the vanilla extract.
Use a spatula to fold in the crushed cookies.
Evenly spread a thin layer of icing onto a cake quarter.
Starting from one short end, tightly roll the cake into a spiral. Repeat with the remaining cake layers, placing the rolled piece at the start of each new layer.
Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour until icing in center is slightly firm.
Use the remaining icing to cover the cake and pipe small swirls on the top. Garnish the top with the sandwich cookie halves, and chill for at least an hour before serving.
Enjoy!
