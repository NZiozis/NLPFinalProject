Preheat oven to 350˚F (175˚C).
In a large pot, over medium-high heat, bring lentils, broth, salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and oregano to a boil.
Once boiling, reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 35 minutes.
Once cooked, mix in the corn and black beans.
On a baking sheet, place a layer of tortilla chips, followed by the lentil mixture and cheese.
Add another layer of tortilla chips, lentils, and cheese.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.
Top with lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeños, and guacamole, and cilantro.
Enjoy!
