NOTE: If you have unroasted nuts, preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread hazelnuts onto a baking tray and bake for 10-12 minutes or until you can smell them.
In a food processor, blend roasted hazelnuts. Scrape down the sides when necessary.
Once the hazelnuts have broken down and become crumbly, add unsweetened cocoa powder, maple syrup, and vanilla extract.
Blend again and slowly add canola oil while still mixing. Add more canola oil if you want a creamier texture.
Pour into a jar, store in a refrigerator and use within one month.
Enjoy!
