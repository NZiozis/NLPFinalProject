Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
On a large baking sheet, toss together the cauliflower florets, olive oil, paprika, salt, and pepper. Roast until tender, 20-25 minutes.
In a large bowl, whisk together the hot sauce, sriracha, melted butter, and lime juice.
Add the roasted cauliflower to the bowl and mix to coat.
Scatter the tortilla chips over the baking sheet. Top with the cauliflower, Monterey Jack cheese, and cheddar cheese.
Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 5 minutes.
Top with avocado, radishes, celery, sour cream, and cilantro. Serve warm.
Enjoy!
