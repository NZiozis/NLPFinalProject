Blanch the corn in a large pot of boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove the corn from the pot.
Let the corn cool slightly, then slice crosswise into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces, about 4 per cob.
In a medium pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the tomato and cook until softened. Add the serrano chili, ground coriander, green chile powder, and turmeric and stir well.
Add the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Add the corn and lemon juice and stir well.
Transfer the corn and sauce to a serving bowl and garnish with cilantro.
Enjoy!
