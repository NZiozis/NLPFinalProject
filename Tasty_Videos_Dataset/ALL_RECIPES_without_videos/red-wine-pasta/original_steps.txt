Pour the red wine and water into a medium pan. Season with salt.
Bring the mixture to a boil and add the spaghetti.
Cook until most of the red wine is absorbed by the pasta, 8-10 minutes.
Transfer the pasta to a medium bowl.
Melt the butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, pine nuts, and red pepper flakes.
Cook the sauce until the butter starts to brown, then add the pasta.
Mix the sauce and pasta together.
Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.
Enjoy!
