Heat oil in a large pot over high heat
Add chicken and cook until no pink is visible, about 5-6 minutes, then take the chicken out.
Add the bell peppers and onion, cooking until the onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.
Add the chicken back to the pot with salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder, stirring until evenly coated, about 30 seconds.
Add the milk and the penne, stirring constantly to prevent any pasta from sticking.
Cook for about 20 minutes until pasta is cooked and the milk has reduced to a thick sauce that coats the pasta.
Add the cheese and mix until melted.
Enjoy!
