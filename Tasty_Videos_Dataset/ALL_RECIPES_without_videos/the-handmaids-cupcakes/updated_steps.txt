Mix the burgundy food coloring with the cream cheese frosting.
Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a round tip and pipe onto the cupcakes.
Place the chocolate truffles on top of the frosting.
Take a small piece of fondant and flatten into a quarter-size circle.
Place on top of a chocolate truffle and gently fold over the sides to resemble a bonnet.
Repeat with the remaining cupcakes.
Enjoy!
