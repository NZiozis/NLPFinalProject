In a blender, combine the apple, wine, orange juice, and brandy and blend until smooth.
Place 4 grape halves in each ice pop mold.
Pour the mixture into the ice pop molds, seal with the lids, and add the ice pop sticks.
Freeze until solid, at least 4 hours, or overnight.
Carefully remove the ice pops from the molds.
Enjoy!
