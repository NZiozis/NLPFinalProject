Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Carefully pierce potatoes with a fork. On a baking sheet, oil the potatoes well and sprinkle with salt.
Bake for about one hour. If making more potatoes, an additional 15 minutes per potato is needed.
Once cooled, cut the potatoes vertically, scoop out the inside, and save the scooped out insides (for mashed potatoes, etc.).
Spread butter on the inside of each scooped out potato.
Add cheese, bacon, one egg per potato, salt, and pepper. Top with chives.
Bake 25 minutes, until the egg white has cooked through.
Serve warm with chives.
Enjoy!
