Spoon a tablespoon of mincemeat onto the middle of a slice of white bread and cover it with another slice to make a sandwich.
Cut a circular shape in the sandwich with a glass, making sure the edges are well sealed.
Repeat for more doughnuts.
To make the egg wash, add the eggs, milk, flour and icing sugar to a large bowl and whisk until smooth.
Dip the doughnuts into the mixture, then fry in oil at 190°C/375°F until golden brown on both sides.
Roll the doughnut in icing sugar.
Enjoy!
