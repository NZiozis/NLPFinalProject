Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a bowl, add the Italian sausage, ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Parmesan, eggs, and milk, and mix until well combined.
Line a large glass bowl with plastic wrap, and spray thoroughly with cooking spray.
Spread the meat mixture along the bottom and sides of the bowl, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick.
Sprinkle mozzarella in the base of the meat mixture, then top the spaghetti with sauce on top.
Using the plastic wrap, form the meat into a large ball, ensuring there are no holes or cracks.
Place ball on a foil-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 40 minutes.
Place a large spoon full of marinara in the center of a plate. Top with the spaghetti-stuffed meatball, marinara, Parmesan, and basil.
Enjoy!
