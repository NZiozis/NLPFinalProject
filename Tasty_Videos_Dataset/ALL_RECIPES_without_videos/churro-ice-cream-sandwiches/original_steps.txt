In a large pot, bring the water, oil, and salt to a boil.
Add the flour and turn the heat off. Quickly stir the flour until it forms a smooth paste/ball.
Transfer the dough into a piping bag lined with a star tip.
Pipe 6-inch (15 cm) spirals onto a sheet lined with parchment paper, starting from the middle and going around in a circle, making sure that there are no gaps between the loops.
Repeat with the remaining dough.
Freeze the circles for at least 2 hours.
Heat oil in a pot over high heat.
Fry the circles until light golden brown, then drain them on a paper towel.
Mix the sugar and the cinnamon in a separate bowl.
Coat each churro disc in the cinnamon sugar mix, shaking off any excess.
Place a scoop of ice cream in between 2 churro discs.
Enjoy!
