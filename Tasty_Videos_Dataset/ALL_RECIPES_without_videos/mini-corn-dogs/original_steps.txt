In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.
Then add the egg and milk. Stir until batter is smooth with no lumps and chill in refrigerator for 25 minutes.
Cut the hot dogs into ⅓ pieces and coat in flour to help batter to stick to the dogs.
Preheat oil to 350ºF (180ºC).
Dunk flour battered hot dogs into corn dog batter by using a fork. Make sure to fully coat the dogs before frying in the oil.
Fry at 350ºF (180ºC) for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown. For even cooking use a slotted steel spoon or a pair of tongs to rotate the floating corn dogs.
Dry off excess oil with paper towels.
Serve with side of veggies or fruit.
Enjoy!
