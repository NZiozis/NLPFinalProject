Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C)
Peel, halve, and core an apple of your choice. Honeycrisp and Granny Smith are both great options for baking.
Make vertical slices in each apple 1 cm (⅓ inch) thick, stopping 2 cms (¾ inch) from the bottom of each apple half.
Baste with a mixture of 1 Tbsp melted butter, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, and ½ tsp cinnamon.
Bake at 400°F (205°C) for 20 minutes.
Optional crumble topping. Cut frozen butter into small nibs. Toss in a combination of 3 Tbsp AP flour and 1 Tbsp white sugar until flour and sugar clump up around butter.
Spoon the crumble topping on top of the apples.
Bake an additional 15 minutes at 425°F (220°C).
Enjoy!
