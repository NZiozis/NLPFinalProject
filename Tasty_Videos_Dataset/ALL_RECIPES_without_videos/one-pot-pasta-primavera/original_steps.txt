In a pot over high heat, combine broth, linguine, broccoli, asparagus, onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Stir.
Add the mushrooms and bring to a boil.
Once at a boil, reduce heat to medium and cook the pasta for 10 minutes, continuously tossing with tongs.
Add the heavy cream, parmesan, and parsley, and toss for an additional 3 minutes.
If the liquid hasnâ€™t been completely absorbed, let the pasta sit off the heat for an additional few minutes.
Enjoy!
