Preheat your oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Freshly shred the cheese. Place your cheese in neat piles on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake for about 8 minutes, until all the individual shreds melt into one disc. Be careful not to let the cheese color too much.
Once they are all melted, let them cool for 2 minutes on your baking sheet, then lift them onto paper towels to blot off any excess grease.
To form the shells, lay them over a propped up utensil. (Or you can use anything in your kitchen, a wide bowl or saucepan could work too!) Set these aside to cool.
To make the taco filling, brown the ground beef on high heat. Make a well in the center, add in the onion, jalapeños, garlic, and sprinkle in the taco seasoning packet. Stir to combine. Add water if you need it for a nice saucy filling.
Use a fork to hold your cheese shell in place and fill with the beef mixture, and toppings of your choice.
Enjoy!
