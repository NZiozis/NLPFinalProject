Lay the puff pastry out on a lightly floured surface and roll out to a 12-inch by 14-inch (30 cm by 35 cm) rectangle.
Use a spatula to spread the chocolate hazelnut spread over the pastry, leaving a ¼-inch (6 mm) border of uncovered pastry.
Roll each side of the sheet inward to meet in the middle.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Use a sharp knife to cut the roll into fourteen ¼-inch (6 mm) thick slices.
Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and brush with egg wash.
Bake for 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
