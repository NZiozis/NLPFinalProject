Put the brussels sprouts into a mixing bowl and add garlic powder, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Lightly grease the baking sheet with oil and spread evenly.
Bake for 20-25 minutes at 400°F (200°C).
For the dressing, mix the Greek yogurt, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
In a large mixing bowl, add mixed greens, shredded carrots, sliced almonds, dried cranberries, shredded parmesan, and the roasted brussels sprouts.
Pour dressing over the salad and mix well.
Enjoy!
