Pre-heat oven according to the cinnamon roll package instructions.
Cut cinnamon rolls into bite-size pieces and set aside.
In a bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon until well combined.
Place cut up cinnamon rolls into an 8" x 8" (20 cm x 20 cm) baking dish. Pour blueberries on top followed by the milk mixture.
Bake for 40-45 minutes or until fully cooked. If the top is looking too brown, cover with foil for the remaining time.
Slice then garnish with icing and serve.
Enjoy!
