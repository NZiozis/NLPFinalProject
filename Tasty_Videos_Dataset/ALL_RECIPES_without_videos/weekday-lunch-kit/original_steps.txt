Preheat oven to 325˚F (160˚C).
To prepare red pepper spread, cut the top quarter off a head of garlic and place in a baking dish or oven-safe skillet with the chopped peppers. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in oven for 1 hour.
Once cooled, combine peppers and garlic, parsley, oregano, and lemon juice in a food processor or blender. Puree, slowly drizzling in remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Chill for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.
Arrange turkey, cucumber, cheddar cheese, red pepper spread and Good Thins Sweet Potato crackers as desired in a resealable food container. Refrigerate until ready to eat.
Enjoy!
