In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, and onion powder.
Slice chicken breasts in half laterally to form 10 thin cutlets.
Place the chicken cutlets between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound out to ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.
Season the chicken with spice mix.
Place the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs in 3 separate shallow dishes. Dredge each cutlet in the flour, then dip in the egg, bread crumbs, back in the egg, and in the bread crumbs once more.
Place the chicken breasts around the border of a baking sheet, so half of each cutlet drapes over the side of the pan.
Place a smaller baking sheet wrapped with plastic wrap in the middle of the larger pan.
Fold the draped halves of the chicken over the smaller pan.
Freeze for 8 hours or overnight.
Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 375°F (190°C).
Fry the chicken taco shells, 2 at a time, for 5 minutes, or until golden brown.
Drain the chicken tacos on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
Fill the chicken tacos with lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo, and cheddar cheese.
Garnish with cilantro and sour cream.
Enjoy!
