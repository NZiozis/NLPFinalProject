Add half of the sliced peppers and onions to your slow cooker.
Layer the chicken and coat all sides with taco seasoning.
Top with garlic, the juice from one lime, and tomatoes (be sure to drain).
Add the remaining peppers and onions, cover and any remaining lime juice.
Cook on high for 3-4 hours.
Remove chicken and cut/shred into slices (chicken left longer will tend to shred more - cook to your preference).
Return the sliced chicken to the slow cooker to marinate in the juices for about 10 more minutes (on LOW) until ready to serve.
NOTE: If you find that there is too much liquid, you can remove till there is a desired amount before serving.
Assemble Fajitas to your liking - we recommend topping with cheese, sour cream, and guacamole!
Enjoy!
