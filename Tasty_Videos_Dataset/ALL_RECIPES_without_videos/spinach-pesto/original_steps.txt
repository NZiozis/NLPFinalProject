In a food processor, add all ingredients to make pesto and blend until walnuts are finely blended.
In a hot pan, add olive oil and cook chicken breast. Salt and pepper to taste.
Remove the chicken and slice.
Combine the chicken and pesto sauce into spaghetti and mix until the sauce fully coats the pasta.
Serve and top it off with parmesan cheese.
Enjoy!
