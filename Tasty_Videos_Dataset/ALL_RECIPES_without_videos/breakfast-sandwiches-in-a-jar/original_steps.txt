Prepare a mason jar lid with oil or nonstick spray of choice to prevent sticking.
Place the mason jar lids upside down on a baking sheet.
Crack 1 egg into each mason jar lid.
Bake the eggs for 10-15 minutes.
Remove the eggs from the oven and let them cool for a minute on the baking sheet.

Assemble the sandwich with one egg, a slice of tomato, and slices of avocado.
Enjoy!
