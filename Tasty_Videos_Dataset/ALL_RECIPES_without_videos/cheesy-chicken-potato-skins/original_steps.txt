Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ªC).
Debone, remove skin, and shred rotisserie chicken.
Brush potatoes with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
With a fork, poke several sets of holes on the front and back of the potato.
Bake for 40-45 minutes or until inside is cooked.
Once potatoes are cooked and cool enough to handle, slice down the center lengthwise, and, using a spoon, scoop out the centers to form a bowl.
In a large bowl, combine the chicken, scooped out potato, ½ cup (50 g) of cheddar, cream cheese, and spinach. Stir until combined.
Evenly distribute the filling between the potato skins and sprinkle the tops with the remaining cheddar.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
