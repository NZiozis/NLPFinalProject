To roast the jalapeños, cut fresh jalapeños in half, then place face down on a baking sheet.
Broil jalapeños until the skins blacken and bubble up.
Remove from broiler and peel outer skin, then dice.
Set aside.
To prepare the dip, in a medium bowl, mix cream cheese and sour cream.
Add cheddar cheese, ¾ cup (75 g) of the parmesan cheese, and diced jalapeños.
Mix well.
In another medium bowl, mix bread crumbs, melted butter, the remaining parmesan cheese, and dried parsley.
Spoon into 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) baking dish, or medium sized cast iron pan, spreading evenly.
Sprinkle bread crumb topping evenly over jalapeño mixture.
Bake at 400˚F (200˚C) for 20 minutes, or until hot and bread crumbs are golden brown.
Serve with bread or crackers.
Enjoy!
