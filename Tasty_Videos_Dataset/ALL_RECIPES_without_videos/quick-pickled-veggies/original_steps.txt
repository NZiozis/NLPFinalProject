Prepare your jar(s). Wash with hot, soapy water and dry completely before proceeding.
Cut the vegetable scraps into bite-size pieces, if necessary. Fill the jar with the vegetable pieces, leaving about Â½ inch of space at the top.
In a large pot, combine the vinegar, salt, peppercorns, red pepper flakes (if using), bay leaves, garlic, mustard seeds, and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, and stir until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved.
Add the ice to the pot and stir until melted, to cool the pickling liquid.
Pour the cooled pickling liquid over the vegetables to cover completely. Cover the jars with a tight-fitting lid and shake to distribute the spices.
The pickles will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. Serve with sandwiches, tacos, salads, or as desired.
Enjoy!
