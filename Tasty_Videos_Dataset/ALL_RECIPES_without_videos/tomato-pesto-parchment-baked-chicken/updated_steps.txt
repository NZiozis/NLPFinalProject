Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Fold the parchment paper in half, then open up.
Trim the ends of the asparagus and lay them on one half of the parchment paper.
Drizzle on oil and sprinkle on salt and pepper.
Lay the chicken on the asparagus, season with salt and pepper, and spread on the pesto.
Top with tomato slices.
Fold the parchment paper over the chicken, and cinch the paper together by folding it over itself along the edges.
Bake for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 165˚F (75˚C).
Enjoy!
