On a cutting board, slice the ends off the pickles and place vertically on the board.
Using an apple corer, hollow out the pickles and reserve the centers for frying.
Place a slice of ham on the cutting board and roll it around a string cheese stick.
Stuff the ham-covered cheese stick in a hollow pickle.
Repeat with the remaining ham, cheese, and pickles.
Cut the stuffed pickles into ¼-inch (6 mm) slices.
Place the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs in 3 separate medium bowls.
Dip each pickle slice in the flour, eggs, then panko, making sure each slice is fully coated.
Dip each cored pickle center into flour, eggs, then panko, making sure each one is fully covered.
Heat the oil in a medium pot until it reaches 375˚F (190˚C).
Fry the pickle slices and cores for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.
Serve with spicy mayonnaise for dipping.
Enjoy!
