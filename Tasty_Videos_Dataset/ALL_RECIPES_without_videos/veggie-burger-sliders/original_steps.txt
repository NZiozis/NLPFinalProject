Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a large bowl, add half of the black beans and mash well (a few chunks are fine).
Add the mushrooms, broccoli, remaining black beans, red onion, garlic, dill, paprika, red pepper flakes, rosemary, salt, pepper, and liquid smoke.
Mix thoroughly, then mash until the mixture is well-combined.
Add the bread crumbs and eggs and mix until thoroughly combined.
Grease a 13x18-inch (33x45 cm) baking sheet with olive oil.
Transfer the veggie burger mixture to the pan. Using a spatula and your hands, form the mixture into a rectangle that is roughly the size of the slider buns.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until firm and browned, flipping halfway through.
Make the avocado dressing: add the avocado, jalapeño, Greek yogurt, garlic, lime juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and water to a blender, and blend until smooth.
Keeping the slider buns attached, cut in half lengthwise with a serrated knife. Remove the top half and set aside.
When veggie burger is done baking, remove from oven and place on top of bottom half of slider buns.
Spread the avocado dressing over the veggie burger, then top with the tomatoes and lettuce.
Cover with the top slider buns, and cut into 12 sliders.
Enjoy!
