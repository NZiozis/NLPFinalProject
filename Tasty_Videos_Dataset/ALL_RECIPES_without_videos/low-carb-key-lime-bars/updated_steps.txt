Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish with parchment paper to hang over the edges.
Make the crust: in a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut oil, honey, cinnamon, and salt.
Mix with a spatula until smooth.
Transfer the crust to the baking dish.
Use a spatula to smooth the crust into a thin, even layer covering the bottom of the pan.
Set aside.
Make the filling: open the cans of coconut milk and use a spoon to scoop the thick cream at the top of the can into a medium bowl.
Set aside the remaining liquid for another use, such as in smoothies, soups, or sauces.
Beat the coconut cream with a hand mixer until very fluffy, about 5 minutes.
Add the lime juice and honey.
Continue to beat until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Pour the filling over the crust and use a spatula to smooth out the top.
Top with the lime zest.
Freeze for at least 2 hours, until the filling has set.
Grab the parchment on both sides and lift the frozen bar from the baking dish.
You may need to use a knife to release the edges or turn the dish upside down on a cutting board and tap on the bottom to release the block.
Quickly cut the block into 16 2-inch (5-cm) square bars.
Enjoy!
