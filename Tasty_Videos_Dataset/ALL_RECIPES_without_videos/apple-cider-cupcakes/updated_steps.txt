Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, salt, olive oil, and vanilla.
Whisk in the eggs, 1 at a time, until fully incorporated.
Add the baking soda, cinnamon, half of the flour, and half of the cider and whisk to combine.
Add the remaining flour and the rest of the cider and whisk until completely combined.
Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Pour the batter into the muffin tin, filling each cup about ⅔ full.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean.
Let cool.
Make the frosting: In a large bowl, cream the butter and cream cheese together with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
Add the powdered sugar in 3 to 4 additions, mixing in between each until incorporated.
Add the cinnamon, apple cider, and vanilla and mix to combine.
Transfer the frosting to a piping bag or zip-top bag.
Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes.
Top with a sprinkle of cinnamon.
Enjoy!
