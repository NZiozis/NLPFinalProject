Over low heat, add water to your saucepan and slowly incorporate the butter, a few tablespoons at a time. Whisk together to make sure the water and butter combine and doesnâ€™t separate.
Add the lemon zest and sprig of thyme and give it a stir. Add the shrimp and poach for eight to 10 minutes. Remove shrimp and set aside. Discard the sprig of thyme.
In the same saucepan and over low heat, add garlic, shallots and the orzo. Salt and pepper to taste. Stir until all the liquid has been absorbed.
Pour in the chicken stock and cook until the orzo is al dente. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.
Once the orzo is al dente, add the spinach. Stir in until just wilted. Remove from heat.
Serve the spinach and orzo, place a few shrimps on top and garnish with chopped parsley.
Enjoy!
