On a cutting board, chop head of lettuce.
In a large bowl, combine the romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, shredded carrots, yellow bell pepper, cucumber, and diced red onion.
To make the dressing, combine the red wine vinegar, honey, dijon mustard, dried oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl, and whisk together until the dressing is thick.
Pour the dressing over the salad just before serving.
Enjoy!
