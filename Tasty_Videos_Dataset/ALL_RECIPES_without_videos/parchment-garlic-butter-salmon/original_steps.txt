Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Fold the parchment paper in half, then open up.
On one half of the parchment, arrange the sliced potatoes. In a small bowl, combine the butter, garlic, and parsley. Drizzle half of the garlic butter mixture over the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper.
Lay the salmon over the potatoes, and drizzle over the remaining garlic butter. Season with salt and pepper.
Fold the parchment paper over the salmon, and cinch the paper together by folding it over itself along the edges.
Bake for 30 minutes or until internal temperature of salmon reaches 145˚F (63˚C).
Enjoy!
