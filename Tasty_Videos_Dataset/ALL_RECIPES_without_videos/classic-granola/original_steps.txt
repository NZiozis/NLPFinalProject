Preheat the oven to 425 °F (220°C).
In a large bowl, add the oats, almonds, cinnamon, salt, coconut oil, vanilla extract, maple syrup, and honey.
Mix until well combined.
Transfer the mixture onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and spread into an even layer.
Bake for 20 minutes.
Carefully remove and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Break up the layer into chunks with your hands.
Store in an airtight container for up to one month.
Serve with Greek yogurt and fresh berries, if desired.
Enjoy!
