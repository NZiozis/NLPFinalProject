Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets.
Place the florets in a food processor and blend until they are a rice-like texture.
Be careful not to over process or it may turn mushy.
Set aside, and drain excess moisture with a towel, if desired.
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the chicken until no pink is showing.
Add the peas, carrots, soy sauce, and black pepper.
Stir until most of the liquid has reduced, then add the cauliflower rice.
Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables and chicken are incorporated evenly into the cauliflower.
Spread the rice towards the edge of the pan, creating a well in the center.
Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked.
Fold the eggs into the rice, then mix in the sesame seeds.
Enjoy!
