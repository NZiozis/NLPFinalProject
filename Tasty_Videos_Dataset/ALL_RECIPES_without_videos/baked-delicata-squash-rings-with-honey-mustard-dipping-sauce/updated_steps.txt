Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the top and bottom of each squash, so you reach the seeds.
Discard the top and bottom pieces.
Slice the remaining squash into ¼-inch (½ cm) thick rounds.
Use a metal teaspoon to scoop out the seeds from the rings.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the bread crumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, paprika, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.
In another bowl, beat the eggs.
Add the flour to another bowl.
Coat each squash ring in the flour, tapping off any excess.
Next, coat in the eggs.
Finally, coat in the bread crumb mixture, making sure to press the breadcrumbs into the squash to adhere.
Place the coated rings on a baking sheet.
Bake the squash rings for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown, flipping once halfway through cooking.
Make the honey mustard dipping sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the Dijon, whole-grain mustard, and honey.
Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 3 days.
Serve the squash rings with the dipping sauce.
