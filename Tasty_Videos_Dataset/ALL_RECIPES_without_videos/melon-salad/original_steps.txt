Using a melon baller or a teaspoon, scoop out rounds of watermelon and cantaloupe and place in a large bowl. Season with a pinch of salt.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, olive oil, water, and lemon juice. Stir until smooth.
Serve the melon in bowls and top with the dressing and fresh mint leaves.
Enjoy!
