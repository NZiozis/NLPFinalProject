Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a medium-size bowl mix together the beef, pork, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, garlic, eggs, salt, and pepper until just combined.
Take a walnut size of the meat mixture and roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining meat and transfer to an oiled rack on a sheet tray.
Bake meatballs for 15 minutes, until golden brown. Set aside.
Melt butter in a pan on medium heat and allow it to brown slightly. Stir in the flour completely and cook for about 1 minute creating a pale roux.
Add the beef broth, stir, and cook until it thickens.
Add in the ground allspice, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and the heavy cream, stir, and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes.
Add the meatballs and coat them with the gravy.
Sprinkle with the parsley, poke with toothpicks, and serve!
Enjoy!
