Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Cut eggplant lengthwise, keeping it connected at the stem.
In a baking dish, place marinara sauce and spread to cover the bottom.
Place the eggplant directly on the sauce.
Slice the tomato and mozzarella into thin slices. Alternate tomatoes, basil, and cheese in each eggplant slice.
Sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic, and olive oil, and cover with foil and bake for 50 minutes until eggplant is tender.
In a small bowl, combine panko, cheese, salt, and pepper.
Place the panko mixture on top of the eggplant and bake uncovered for another 5 minutes. Or until the bread crumbs are golden brown.
Cut into your desired size pieces.
Enjoy!
