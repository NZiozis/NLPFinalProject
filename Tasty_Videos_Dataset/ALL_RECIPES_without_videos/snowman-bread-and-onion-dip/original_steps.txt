Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Thaw the dinner rolls. Split 4 of them in half, and roll them into small balls. Place on a greased baking sheet, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise while you make the dip.
In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, onion, ¾ cup (75 gram) of white cheddar, salt, and pepper. Spread the dip into a greased pie dish and sprinkle with the remaining ¼ cup (25 gram) of cheddar.
Bake for 30 minutes.
Remove the dip from the oven and top with the dinner rolls, larger ones on the outside, smaller ones on the inside.
Decorate with pieces of tomato for the scarf, a piece of carrot for the nose, and peppercorns for the eyes and buttons. Make sure to push them in hard!
Bake for an additional 20 minutes.
Enjoy!
