Cut the apple into 6 wedges.
Remove the core and seeds.
To create the ears: Using a paring knife, make two intersecting slits about Â¾ of the way down the skin side of each apple slice.
Do not cut too deep.
Remove the piece of apple between the slits.
Soak the apple wedges in salt water or lemon water until ready to eat.
Enjoy!
