Heat oil in a pan over medium heat until it begins to shimmer.
Add the broccoli and sprinkle with salt, stirring to coat in the oil.
Cook for 5 minutes, without moving the broccoli.
Add chicken stock and place a lid on the pan, and cook for 1 minute.
Remove the lid and add the garlic and red pepper flakes.
Stir, cooking for 1 minute.
Enjoy!
