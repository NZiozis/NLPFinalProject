Thinly slice all the fresh radishes. Set aside.
Cut the avocado in half, and use a knife to slice the inside, then scoop out the avocado into a bowl.
Mash the avocado with lime, salt and pepper.
Spread the mixture on some toasted bread.
Top the avocado toast with the sliced radishes and any other garnishes you would like.
Sprinkle with salt and cracked pepper.
Enjoy!
