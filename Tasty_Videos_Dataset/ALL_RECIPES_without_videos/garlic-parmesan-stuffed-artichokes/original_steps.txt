Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Trim the stem off the artichoke to create a base and also one inch (2 ½ cm) from the top.
Remove the leaves from the center of the artichoke and use a spoon to scrape out the hairs on the heart of the artichoke.
Squeeze the juice of one small lemon on top.
In a saucepan, boil two inches (5 cm) of salted water. Place the artichokes in the pot cover and boil for 20 minutes, or until tender.
In a separate pan, melt the butter and saute the garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Squeeze in the juice of one lemon. Add in the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and parsley. Stir until combined.
Place the artichokes on a pan and fill with bread crumb mixture and top with grated parmesan.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Serve with dipping sauce of choice.
Enjoy!
