Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Add the tater tots to a 10-inch (25 cm) springform pan. Use a flat-bottomed measuring cup to flatten the tots against the sides and bottom of the pan, creating a ½-inch (1 cm) thick tater tot crust.
Spread the shredded cheese evenly over the bottom of the crust.
Arrange cheddar slices along the walls and base, overlapping slightly.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden brown.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt, pepper, paprika, bacon, and milk.
When the crust is par-baked, remove from the oven and place the ham slices along the wall and base of the crust, overlapping slightly.
Pour the egg mixture into the center.
Add zucchini slices and cherry tomato halves on top.
Bake for 1 hour, or until the center is set.
Slice and serve warm.
Enjoy!
