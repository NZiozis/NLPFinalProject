Roll each slice of bread flat with a rolling pin. Carefully cut off the crusts.
Spread desired amount of cream cheese and strawberries along the edge of the bread, and roll up.
In a bowl, combine eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla.
Dip each roll-up in egg mixture, and pan fry in a buttered skillet until all sides are golden brown.
Enjoy!
