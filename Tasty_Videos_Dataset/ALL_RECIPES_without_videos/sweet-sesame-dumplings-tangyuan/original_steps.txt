Make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the ground black sesame seeds, powdered sugar and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Roll 1 tablespoon scoops of the mixture into balls. Set aside.
Make the dough: Add the rice flour to a medium bowl. Gradually add the water and mix with your hands until the dough comes together.
On a lightly floured surface, turn out the dough. Shape into a ball and cut in half. Roll the dough into 2 logs, then cut into about 16 2-3-ounce (55G -85G) portions.
Flatten a dough portion in your palm and add a sesame ball to the center. Encase the filling with the dough and roll into a ball. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the sugar and osmanthus flower. Drop the dumplings into the boiling water. Gently stir so they donâ€™t stick to the bottom of the pot. Cook until the dumplings float to the surface, then remove from the pot.
Serve the dumplings in a bowl with the cooking liquid.
Enjoy!
