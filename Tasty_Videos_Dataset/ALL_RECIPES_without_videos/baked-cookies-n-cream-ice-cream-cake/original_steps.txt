Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease 2 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with nonstick spray.
In a large bowl, combine the melted ice cream, cake mix, and egg whites. Whisk until smooth.
Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake according to the package instructions, about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Place 1 cake on a cake stand or platter. Spread an even layer of frosting over the cake. Sprinkle 6 of the crushed chocolate sandwich cookies evenly over the frosting. Top with the other cake layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting over the top and sides of the cake.
Chill the cake in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Coat the top and sides of the cake with frosting. Transfer the remaining frosting to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag fitted with a medium star tip. Pipe 8 1½-inch (20 cm) swirls of frosting around the outside of the cake. Place a chocolate sandwich cookie vertically in each swirl. Sprinkle the remaining 4 crushed cookies in the center.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
