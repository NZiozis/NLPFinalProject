NOTE: This recipe contains higher dry ingredients to wet ingredients ratio, so macarons do not need to form a “shell” before baking into the oven.
Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).
Whisk the egg whites until they stick to the bowl.
Add the sugar to the whipped egg whites and beat until stiff peaks form.
Sift powdered sugar, almond meal, and graham crackers to the whipped egg whites. Gently fold ingredients together.
Transfer the batter to a piping bag and pipe directly onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes.
In a bowl, add the hot cream and chocolate chips and whisk to combine.
Put the chocolate filling in a piping bag and refrigerate for 2 hours, until firm.
Pipe filling onto the macaron shells.
Place a marshmallow between two macaron shells, creating a sandwich.
Gently place a skewer into the macarons, then lightly toast with a torch.
Refrigerate macarons for another 2 hours before serving.
Enjoy!
