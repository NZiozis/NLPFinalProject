In a bowl, mix the beans and salsa.
Put the sour cream in a plastic bag.
Cut off the end of one corner of the bag.
Spread the bean mixture onto a plate.
Spread guacamole over the beans.
Pipe out a bullseye pattern of sour cream over the guacamole.
Run a toothpick through the sour cream from the center outward, until it looks like a spiderweb.
Garnish with lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and black olives.
Serve with tortilla chips.
Enjoy!
