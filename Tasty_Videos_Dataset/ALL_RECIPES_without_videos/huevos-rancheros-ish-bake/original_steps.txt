Preheat your oven to 375˚F (190˚C)
In vegetable oil, lightly fry your corn tortillas. Drain on a paper towel.
In a 9 inch (25cm) cast iron skillet, arrange your lightly fried tortillas so they cover the bottom of the skillet.
Add black beans evenly over tortillas. (Some will fall in-between the tortillas, thats ok!)
Sprinkle Mexican blend cheese over the black beans.
Add pico de gallo on top of the cheese.
Using the back of a large spoon, create 6 wells in the pico de gallo for the eggs to rest in.
Crack one egg into each well (6 wells for 6 eggs).
Pour enchilada sauce over everything!
Bake for 20-25 minutes. Check on it often to make sure your yolks don’t overcook!
Top with your favorite huevos rancheros toppings.
Enjoy!
