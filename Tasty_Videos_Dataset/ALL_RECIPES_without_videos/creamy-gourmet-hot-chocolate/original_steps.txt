In a 1.5-quart saucepan over medium heat, whisk together whole milk, heavy cream, powdered sugar, and espresso powder until hot.
Small bubbles will appear around the edges and the mixture may start to steam. Do not allow the mixture to boil.
Turn heat to low and stir in chopped chocolate until melted completely.
Serve warm, topped with whipped cream.
Enjoy!
