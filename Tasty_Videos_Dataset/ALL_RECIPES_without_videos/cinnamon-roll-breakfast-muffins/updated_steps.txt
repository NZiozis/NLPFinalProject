In a medium bowl, mix eggs, milk, cream, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and sugar.
Whisk together.
Cut each cinnamon roll into eight pieces, and stuff inside a greased muffin tin.
Pour batter in each tin about ¾ of the way.
If you pour too much, the tin will overflow in the oven.
Cover the tin and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, letting the cinnamon roll absorb the mixture.
Bake at 350˚F (175˚C) for 35 minutes.
Remove the muffin from the tin, top with icing and serve warm.
Enjoy!
