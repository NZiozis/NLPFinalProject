In a medium bowl, mix Doce de Leite and melted butter.
In a separate medium bowl, mix egg yolks and eggs. Once combined, mix in Doce de Leite mixture.
Add in flour, a little at a time, to ensure everything is mixed evenly and the batter is smooth.
Line ramekins with butter and flour. Pour out excess flour. Divide Doce de Leite batter in each ramekin. Leave about ¼ inches (6 ⅓mm) from the top.
Bake the cakes for 425˚F (220˚C) for 12-14 minutes. The cakes should be golden brown and should jiggle in the middle. The more you bake, the less molten the center will be when you cut into it.
Run a knife along the edges of the ramekin to loosen and invert onto a plate. Serve with ice cream or whipped cream.
Enjoy!
