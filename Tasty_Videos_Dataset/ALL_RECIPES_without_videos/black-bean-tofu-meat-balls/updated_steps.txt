Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a blender or food processor, add tofu, black beans, onion, spinach, garlic, and tomato paste, and blend until smooth.
Transfer to a large bowl.
To the bowl, add the oregano, salt, pepper, paprika, breadcrumbs, and egg.
Mix well until a dough forms.
Use your hands to form 1-inch (2-cm) balls from the black bean and tofu mixture.
Place in rows on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden, flipping halfway.
Enjoy!
