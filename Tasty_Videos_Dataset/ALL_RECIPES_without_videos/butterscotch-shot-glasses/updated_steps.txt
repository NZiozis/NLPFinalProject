Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).
Cut parchment paper into a 5×5 (13x13 cm) square and place on a baking sheet.
Arrange candies into a circle with one candy in the middle.
Bake for about five minutes, or until the candies have melted into one molten piece.
Slide parchment paper and molten candy from the baking tray to a cold counter top and let it cool for 30-45 seconds.
CAREFULLY (will still be very hot) and quickly peel the paper off and place the center of the candy on an upside down shot glass.
Push the sides of the candy down around the glass quickly with your fingers and let it harden and cool to room temperature.
Flip the glass over and remove the shot glass.
Make sure that whatever liquid you are pouring and the candy shot glass are the same temperature, or else the candy will crack.
Enjoy!
