Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yogurt, honey, strawberries, and coconut oil until well combined.
Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and fold the batter together using a rubber spatula.
Stop folding once all of the dry ingredients have disappeared into the batter.
Using a medium ice cream scoop, pour one scoop full of batter into each well of a greased muffin tin.
Bake for for 20-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
Enjoy!
