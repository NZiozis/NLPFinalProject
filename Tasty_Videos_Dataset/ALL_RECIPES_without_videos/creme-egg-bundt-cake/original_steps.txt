Add the flour, caster sugar, cocoa powder, butter, eggs, baking powder and vanilla extract to a large bowl and whisk until smooth and thoroughly mixed.
Transfer mixture to the bundt cake tin, smooth out then place 6 creme eggs upright around the circle. Make sure they don’t touch the bottom but are sunken in.
Cover the creme eggs with the cake mix, then bake for 35 minutes at 180°C (350°F). Cool for 20 minutes.
Remove cake from tin carefully, then pour melted chocolate over the top, covering completely.
Cut 3-4 creme eggs in half and decorate over the top - the messier the better!
Enjoy!
