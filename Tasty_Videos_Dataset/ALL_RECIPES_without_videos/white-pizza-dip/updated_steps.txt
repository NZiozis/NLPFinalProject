Divide pizza dough into 12-14 equal sized balls.
With floured hands, roll the dough balls into logs and tie into individual knots, tucking the excess underneath.
Coat a 10 inch (25 cm) oven-safe skillet with olive oil.
Place the knots in a ring around the skillet.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes, allowing the dough to reach room temperature.
In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, fresh basil, 3 cloves of garlic (chopped), and red pepper flakes.
Melt the butter and add the fresh parsley and remaining garlic.
Stir well.
Uncover the knots and scoop the dip into the center of the skillet.
Brush the knots with the butter/garlic mixture (reserving some for after baking), and top the dip with an additional sprinkle of cheese (optional).
Bake in a preheated oven (400˚F/200˚C) for 20 minutes.
Broil on high for two additional minutes or until knots and cheese are lightly browned, watching closely so as not to burn it.
Remove from oven and brush lightly with additional garlic butter.
Let cool slightly before serving.
Enjoy!
