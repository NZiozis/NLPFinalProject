Cut seven slits on the top of the chicken breast.
In each slit, spread 1 teaspoon of tomato puree, 1 mozzarella slice, and 1 salami slice.
Sprinkle on the cheddar cheese and oregano.
Bake for 20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
It should have an internal temperature of 165˚F (75˚C).
Enjoy!
