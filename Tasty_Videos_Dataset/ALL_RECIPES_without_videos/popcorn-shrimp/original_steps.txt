In a medium bowl, add seasoned flour ingredients. Mix well.
Place half of the flour mixture into a large zip lock bag, reserve the rest.
Add the shrimp to the bag and shake until each shrimp is coated with flour. Shake off any excess flour.
In a separate bowl, add egg, milk, and cajun seasoning. Mix well.
Dredge the floured shrimp in the egg mixture, then coat with the fresh seasoned flour mixture.
Heat oil at 350°F (180°C).
Fry shrimp for a few minutes until golden brown and cooked through.
Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
