In a large mixing bowl beat together powdered sugar, cream cheese, and peanut butter.
Fold in half of the whipped topping.
Crush half a graham cracker into the bottom or a jam jar.
Drizzle a layer off hard shell over the graham cracker (this will firm up and act as a barrier to ensure the graham crackers stay crunchy).
Spoon in the peanut butter pie mixture, filling the jam jar Â¾ of the way.
Top off with whipped topping and additional toppings to your liking.
Chill the jars in the fridge for at least 1 hour before serving.
Enjoy!
