Stack the slices of bread and cut the crusts off.
Arrange the slices in a 3" x 3" (7.5cm x 7.5cm) square on clingfilm, overlapping them slightly.
Roll out with a rolling pin until they are all combined together.
Spread ketchup over the square, then add the scrambled egg, bacon and sausages to the bottom third of the square.
Drizzle ketchup on top of the sausages.
Roll up and remove the cling film.
Cut in half.
Heat up the butter in a pan and fry the rolls in butter until all sides are golden brown.
Enjoy!
