Blanch the cabbage leaves in boiling water for 3 minutes, then transfer directly to a large bowl of ice water.
Remove the tough stem, finely dice and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the ground pork, ground beef, diced cabbage stems, onion, egg, salt, and pepper, and mix until well-combined.
Divide into four equal parts.
Fold the mozzarella slices in half and roll them up.
Form each portion of meat into a patty.
Add a roll of cheese to each patty and form the meat around the cheese so it is completely encased.
Put a meat patty on a cabbage leaf, fold in front and right side, and roll up.
Fold the left side inwards towards the meat filling to seal.
Repeat with the remaining meat and cabbage.
Heat a bit of oil in a medium pan over medium heat.
Add thecabbage rolls and fry for 3 minutes, until browned on one side.
Turn cabbage rolls over and add the water, bullion, and butter.
Once the water is boiling, add the canned tomatoes.
Cover and cook for 15 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley, then serve.
Enjoy!
