In a pot over medium-high heat, reduce strawberries and water until there is a jam-like consistency and much of the liquid is evaporated.
Reduce the heat to low, add butter, condensed milk, and white chocolate, stirring continuously until you can see the bottom of the pot for 2-3 seconds when dragging a spatula through.
Pour onto a greased plate, then chill for 1 hour.
Shape and roll the chilled mixture into balls.
Roll the balls in sprinkles.
Enjoy!
