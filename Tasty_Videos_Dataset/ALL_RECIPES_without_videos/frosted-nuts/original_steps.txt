Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).
In a large bowl, combine the walnuts, egg whites, sugar, and salt and mix with a rubber spatula until the walnuts are well-coated.
Spread the walnut mixture evenly on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 30-40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until the walnuts are crystallized.
Cool completely.
Enjoy!
