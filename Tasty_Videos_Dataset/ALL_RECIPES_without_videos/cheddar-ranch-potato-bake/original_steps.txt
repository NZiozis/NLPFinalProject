Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
Slice the potatoes in half, lengthwise, then slice each half lengthwise three times and across four times, to cube.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil and drop in chopped potatoes, cook 10 minutes.
Drain potatoes and mix in ranch, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Transfer to a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until nicely browned.
While still hot, mix in cheddar and chives.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
