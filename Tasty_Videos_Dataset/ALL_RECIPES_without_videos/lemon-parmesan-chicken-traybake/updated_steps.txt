Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (350˚F).
Prepare the chicken coating by mixing together the breadcrumbs, parmesan, flour, lemon zest, garlic powder, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Set aside.
Cut the chicken into large nuggets and season with salt and pepper.
Place each nugget into the egg yolk, then coat with the breadcrumb-parmesan mixture.
Place on a baking tray.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Flip the chicken over and add the asparagus and tomatoes.
Drizzle over the olive oil, lemon juice, parmesan, salt and parsley.
Bake for 10 more minutes or until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are cooked but still firm.
Enjoy!
