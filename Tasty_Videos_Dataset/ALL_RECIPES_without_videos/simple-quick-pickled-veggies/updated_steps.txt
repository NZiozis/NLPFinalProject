Cut the vegetables into the shapes of your choosing.
Fill the jars with vegetables, leaving Â½ inch (1 cm) of space at the top.
Add spices of choice to the jars with the vegetables.
We like plain beets, cucumbers with mustard seeds and peppercorns, carrots with ginger and fennel seeds, and red onion with peppercorns.
In a medium pot over high heat, combine the water, vinegar, sugar, and salt.
Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve.
Bring to a boil.
Once boiling, remove the brine from the heat and pour into the jars.
Tap the jars against the counter to release any bubbles.
Close the jars and allow to cool completely at room temperature.
Refrigerate the jars for 48 hours before eating the pickles.
Store for up to 1 week in a refrigerator.
Enjoy!
