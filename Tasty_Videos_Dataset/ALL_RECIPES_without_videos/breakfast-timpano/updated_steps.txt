Make the flour tortilla: In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.
Add the olive oil and mix well.
The texture should look like coarse cornmeal.
Add the water and knead until the dough comes together in a ball.
If it is too wet, add more flour.
Wrap the dough with plastic wrap or cover with a damp cloth.
Let rest for 10 minutes.
Make the sautéed vegetables: In a large skillet, heat the canola oil over medium heat.
Add the onions and bell peppers.
Season with the salt and oregano.
Cook until the vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes.
Remove from the pan and set aside.
Make the home fries: In a large skillet, heat the canola oil over medium heat.
Add the potatoes.
Season with the salt, pepper, and paprika.
Cook until the outsides of the potatoes are slightly crispy, about 5 minutes.
Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Grease 10-inch (25 cm) diameter Dutch oven well with olive oil.
Remove the dough from the fridge and transfer to a lightly floured surface.
Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to about ⅛ inch (3 mm) thick and 2 times larger than the Dutch oven.
Transfer the rolled out dough to the pot, pressing down around the edges so it forms to the inside of the pot and letting the excess hang over the sides.
Layer the home fries, bacon, cheese, spinach, breakfast sausages, sautéed vegetables, scrambled eggs and cooked Italian sausages over the dough.
Fold the overhanging dough over the top.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
Let cool for 30 minutes.
Invert the timpano onto a cutting board and let cool for 10 more minutes before slicing.
Enjoy!
