Blend together the banana, half of the strawberries, half of the blueberries, half of the raspberries, and all of the yogurt in a food processor.
Remove the blade, then stir in the rest of the fruit.
Pour this mixture into a bread tin and put 12 lollipop sticks in, evenly spaced apart.
Freeze overnight.
Allow to defrost for approx 15-20 minutes.
Remove from tin, and cut the lollipops out with a sharp knife.
Enjoy!
