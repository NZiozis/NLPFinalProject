Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
In a small bowl, steep the teabags in the hot water for about 5-10 minutes.
Let cool and take the teabags out, keeping the water.
In a blender, blend the the medjool dates, cinnamon, nutmeg and teabag water to a smooth puree.
For the cake, in a large bowl add the butter and both sugars, cream together using a wooden spoon until light and fluffy.
Next, beat in the eggs one by one, using a metal spoon.
Fold in the flour, followed by the puree.
Pour into a thoroughly greased bundt cake tin and smooth out the top.
Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, until golden brown and cooked through.
Prepare the caramel sauce by melting the butter and two sugars together in a saucepan over a low-medium heat.
Stir in the rum and double cream.
Bring to the boil and simmer for about 5 minutes.
Pour into a jug and leave to cool.
Once the cake is ready, flip onto a cooling rack.
Using a pastry brush, gently brush some of the caramel sauce all over the bundt cake so that it is completely covered.
This will help keep the cake nice and moist.
Pour what’s left of the caramel over the top of the cake.
Enjoy!
