In a blender, combine the cashews, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and 1 cup (235 ml) of water.
Blend for 1 minute, until very smooth.
In a small pot, bring the remaining water to a boil over medium heat.
Slowly add the agar-agar flakes while whisking continuously.
Continue to whisk the mixture until thick, about 2 minutes.
Allow the mixture to cool until the steam evaporates, then add to the blender with the other ingredients.
Blend for 1 minute, until smooth.
Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until thickened.
When ready to serve, invert the cashew cheese onto a plate.
Slice or mash into cashew cheese spread and serve.
Enjoy!
