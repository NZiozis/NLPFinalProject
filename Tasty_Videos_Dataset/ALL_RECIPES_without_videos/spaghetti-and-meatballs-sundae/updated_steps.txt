Thaw the ice cream at room temperature until it is soft to the touch, about 20 minutes, so it will pass through the ricer easily.
Over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, fill the potato ricer with ice cream and press it through, so the ice cream forms “spaghetti”-like noodle piles.
Freeze until firm, at least 45 minutes.
Transfer the “spaghetti” to a serving plate.
Carefully spoon over the strawberry sundae topping to mimic marinara sauce, and top with the brownie bite “meatballs,” if using.
Grate white chocolate over the top to mimic Parmesan cheese.
Enjoy!
