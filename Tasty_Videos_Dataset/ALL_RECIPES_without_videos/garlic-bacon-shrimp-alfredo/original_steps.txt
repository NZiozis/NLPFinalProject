In a large pot, cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy.
Add the shrimp, salt, and pepper and cook until the shrimp is pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp and bacon from the pot, leaving any fat from cooking the bacon behind.
Add the onions, tomatoes, and garlic to the pot and cook until the garlic is starting to brown.
Add the cream and bring to a boil.
Once the cream is boiling, add the fettuccine. Return the shrimp and bacon to the pan, along with the Parmesan cheese and parsley. Stir until the cheese melts and the sauce coats the shrimp and pasta nicely.
Enjoy!
