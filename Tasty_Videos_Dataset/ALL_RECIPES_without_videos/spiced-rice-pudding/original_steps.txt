In a medium sauce pot, combine the rice, 2 cups (470 ml) of milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Cook for 15 minutes, or until thick and creamy.
In a small bowl, combine remaining milk and the egg. Whisk well.
Add the egg mixture to the pot of rice. Stir well and cook for 3 minutes.
Add the nutmeg and cinnamon, and mix well.
Enjoy!
