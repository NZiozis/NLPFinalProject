Preheat oven to 425ºF (220ºC).
In a small mixing bowl, combine flour, chili powder, garlic powder, pepper, and salt.
Pat the chicken wings dry using a paper towel.
Batter them in the flour mixture and place chicken wings on a wired baking sheet.
Bake at 425ºF (220ºC) for 45 minutes, flipping halfway for even cooking.
In a food processor or blender, mix together the mango, habanero peppers, garlic, paprika, apple cider vinegar, and lime juice. Blend until fully combined. The mixture should be a bright orange vibrant color.
In a saucepan, combine honey with your mango habanero mixture at medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and simmer for 5-10 minutes or until your sauce reaches a prefered consistency.
Fully coat your cooked wings in the sauce then place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Bake at 450ºF (230ºC) for 8-10 minutes or until sauce has slightly caramelized.
Enjoy!
