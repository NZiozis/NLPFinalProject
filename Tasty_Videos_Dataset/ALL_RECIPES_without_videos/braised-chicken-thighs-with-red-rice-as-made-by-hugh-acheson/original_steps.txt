Season the chicken thighs on both sides with the salt and pepper.
Heat the oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed pot with a lid over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down and let cook without disturbing for 10 minutes. This will allow the skin to caramelize and develop a ton of flavor in the process. Turn the thighs over, cook for 1 minute more, then transfer to a plate.
Add the onion, tomatoes, poblano, garlic, and paprika to the pan. Cook for 5 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.
Carefully add the vinegar and stir to loosen any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook until the vinegar is reduced by half, 2-4 minutes, then pour in the stock.
Return the chicken to the pan, skin-side up. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes, then remove lid and continue cooking until the internal temperature of the chicken thighs reaches 165˚F (75˚C).
Meanwhile, make the red rice: In a large pan, cook the slab bacon over medium heat until the fat renders and it begins to crisp, 5-8 minutes.
Add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and jalapeño and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.
Add the rice and stir until toasted, about 2 minutes.
Stir in the tomatoes, ½ cup (100 G) of the reserved tomato juice, bay leaves, and season with salt. 9. Add the chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.
Serve the chicken over the rice with some of the braising jus and vegetables ladled over.
Enjoy!
