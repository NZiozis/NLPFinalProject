In a medium bowl, combine the farro, lentils, tomatoes, cucumber, yellow pepper, red pepper, and parsley.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, and whisk until well-combined.
Pour the vinaigrette over the farro salad and toss until well-combined.
Distribute the farro salad into airtight containers with the arugula, if using.
Refrigerate for up to 5 days.
Enjoy!
