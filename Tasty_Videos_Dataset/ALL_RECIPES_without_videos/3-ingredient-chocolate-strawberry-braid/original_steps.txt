Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
In a small bowl, melt the chocolate chips.
Cut puff pastry in half.
Cut slits 1 inch (2 cm) apart on both ends of the pastry, leaving the middle section untouched.
Spread half of the chocolate spread and sliced strawberries on the center third.
Starting at one end, fold the pastry strips over the chocolate/strawberry mixture, alternating sides until mixture is completely covered.
Repeat for second half of puff pastry.
Bake for 12-15 minutes.
Let cool for 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
