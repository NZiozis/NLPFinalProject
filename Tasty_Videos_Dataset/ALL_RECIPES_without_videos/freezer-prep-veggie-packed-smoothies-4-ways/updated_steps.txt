Excluding the milk, combine all ingredients for each smoothie in a resealable bag and freeze.
NOTE: They can be kept in the freezer for up to 6 months!
Remove from freezer and pour your desired smoothie combination into the blender along with the milk.
Blend until smooth, and add more milk if needed.
Enjoy!
