Blend all ingredients in a blender until completely combined.
Divide among all the cups of a greased muffin tin, cups will be about ⅓ full.
Bake at 400°F/200°C for 13-15 minutes. Pancakes will puff up super big, then deflate when you remove them from the oven.
Fill with whatever you want—fresh fruit and syrup, bacon and eggs, sausage, or jam and whipped cream.
Enjoy!
