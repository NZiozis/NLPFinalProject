In a food processor, pulse the sweet potato chunks until they reach your desired “rice” consistency.
In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil, then add onions and let cook until translucent.
Add sweet potato rice, carrots, salt, pepper, and vegetable broth and cook until the liquid has evaporated and the sweet potato is tender, stirring occasionally.
Add peas, eggs, and soy sauce, and combine, allowing it to heat through.
Garnish with green onions.
Enjoy!
