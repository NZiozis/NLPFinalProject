In a non-stick skillet, toast the walnuts over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and set aside.
In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice, water, honey, thyme, salt, and pepper.
While whisking, slowly add the oil to the bowl to create a vinaigrette.
In a large salad bowl, add the mixed greens, pears, beets, onions, walnuts, and lemon vinaigrette. Toss to combine all ingredients and serve.
Enjoy!
