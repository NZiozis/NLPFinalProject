Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
Peel, core, and cut apples into ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) chunks.
In a bowl, mix the chopped apples, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, salt, and orange zest.
Set aside.
On parchment paper, stack 2 pie crusts on top of each other.
Roll out to 17 inches by 12 inches (43 cm by 30 cm).
Cut diagonally into ¾-inch (2 cm) strips.
Roll out another 2 pie crusts.
Place on a 15 x 10 x 1 inch ( 38 x 26 x 3 cm) baking sheet.
Spread out apple mixture into the crust, then form a lattice top with the pie crust strips.
Tuck the crust inward around the edges, and bake for 35-40 minutes at 400°F (200˚C).
Serve warm with ice cream.
Enjoy!
