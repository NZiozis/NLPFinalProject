Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Melt ¾ cup (75 g) mozzarella and cream cheese together in the microwave for 1 minute, stirring every 20 seconds, or until fully melted.
Combine almond (or coconut) flour, baking powder, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and egg. Mix well, then stir in the melted mozzarella until fully incorporated. Shape into a ball, cover, and chill for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
Dust a cutting board with a handful of almond (or coconut) flour. Cut dough into 4 even pieces and roll each piece into a log shape about 6 inches (15 cm) long. Place on a greased baking sheet.
Sprinkle the rest of the mozzarella on top and a pinch of Italian seasoning on each breadstick. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
