Using a serrated knife, cut the pint of ice cream crosswise into 3 equal discs.
Lay out 3 chocolate cookies and place a pint slice on top of each. Place another chocolate cookie on top of each sandwich. Remove the ice cream packaging.
Freeze for 30 minutes.
Pour the sprinkles into a shallow dish.
Remove the ice cream sandwiches from the freezer and roll the sides in the sprinkles, completely covering the ice cream.
Freeze for 30 minutes more before serving.
Enjoy!
