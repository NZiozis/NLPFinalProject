Prepare the Brussels sprouts, carrots, and beets using the grating insert or a box grater. Add to a 3-quart (2.8-liter) mixing bowl.
Thinly slice the radishes with the slicing insert or a sharp knife and add to the bowl with the rest of the vegetables.
Thinly slice the red onion and add to the bowl with the cauliflower and apple. Season with salt and toss to combine.
Roughly chop the pistachios. In a small saut√© pan over medium heat, toast the pistachios until they are lightly browned and smell nutty, 3-5 minutes.
Make the dressing: In a blender, combine the apple cider vinegar, tahini, maple syrup, cayenne, and garlic. Blend until smooth. With the blender running, drizzle in the olive oil to emulsify. Add water as needed to thin the dressing to your desired consistency. Add the poppy seeds and pulse to incorporate.
Toss the slaw with the dressing. Top with the toasted pistachios.
Serve immediately or cover with the lid and take to go. The slaw will keep for 2 hours at room temperature, or in the refrigerator for 1 day with the dressing or 3 days without.
Enjoy!
