Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).
Cut the chicken breasts in half widthwise to make 4 thin breasts.
Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and onion powder.
Coat the chicken in flour, then egg, and then bread crumbs.
Pour oil in a cast-iron skillet to come ¼ inch up the side. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and fry on both sides until brown, about 4 minutes.
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Place the fried chicken breasts in a baking dish. If they don’t fit side by side, gently overlap them. Pour the marinara over the chicken.
Top with mozzarella slices and Parmesan.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is browned and bubbling.
Serve with freshly chopped basil.
Enjoy!
