Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F).
In a small pan, place the sugar, water, and cinnamon stick.
Simmer for 3 minutes and set aside.
Combine milk and cream in a saucepan and place over a medium heat.
Bring mixture to a boil, then remove from the heat and set aside.
To a large bowl, add the egg yolks, whole egg, vanilla extract, and corn flour.
Whisk until fully combined and no lumps remain.
Temper the egg mixture by introducing the hot milk and cream in two 100 milliliter batches, then whisk.
Return mixture to the saucepan and place over a low-medium heat.
Whisk continually until mixture thickens.
Turn off heat.
Remove cinnamon stick from the syrup and slowly trickle into the custard, whisking continually.
Lightly flour a work surface and cut puff pastry into 12 equal pieces.
To a lightly greased muffin tin, push each piece of puff pastry down and up into the sides of the muffin holes until evenly distributed.
Pour custard into each muffin tin so each one is three quarters full.
Bake for 16-20 minutes until golden and brown.
Serve warm with a dusting of icing sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
Enjoy!
