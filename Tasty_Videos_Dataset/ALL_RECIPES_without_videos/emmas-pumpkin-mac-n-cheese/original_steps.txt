Chop up the pumpkin into chunks and place on a baking tray.
Drizzle over the oil, salt, pepper, and ground sage, and coat evenly with your hands.

Continue to stir and cook the sauce for a further 5-10 minutes or until the sauce is simmering and thickened.

Stir in the blended pumpkin.
Stir in the remaining whole pumpkin and macaroni, mix until combined.
Top with the cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan.
Grill for 10 minutes at 200°C (400°F) until the cheese is brown and bubbling.
