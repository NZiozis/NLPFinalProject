Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Place sweet potatoes and chicken breast on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray and season with olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika.
Bake until chicken is cooked through and sweet potatoes are tender, 15-18 minutes.
Slice the chicken breast.
In a measuring cup, add the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, honey, mustard, salt, pepper, and cinnamon and whisk to combine.
Toss the sweet potatoes and sliced chicken with the sliced apples, feta, and walnuts and drizzle with vinaigrette.
Enjoy!
