Crush graham crackers into a fine crumb and pour into a medium mixing bowl (break up any remaining large pieces).
Add the mini chocolate chips, ¼ tsp salt, and marshmallow fluff.
Mix until well combined.
Roll the mixture into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) balls and place on a wax paper lined baking sheet.
Freeze for 15 minutes.
Break apart chocolate bars and add to a microwave safe bowl.
Microwave chocolate for 75 seconds, stopping every 30 seconds to check and stir.
Remove balls from the freezer and individually roll in melted chocolate to coat.
Place back on a wax paper lined tray and sprinkle with coarse salt.
Chill until firm.
Enjoy!
