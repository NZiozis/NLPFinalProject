Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a large bowl, prepare the cake batter.
Divide the batter evenly among a lined muffin tin, filling halfway.
Place a peanut butter cup in each, then top with remaining batter, filling about ¾ of the way up.
Bake for 20 minutes, then cool.
In a separate bowl, combine peanut butter and vanilla frosting, stirring until smooth.
Then halve the remaining peanut butter cups.
Pipe the frosting onto each cupcake, then top with the peanut butter cup halves.
Enjoy!
