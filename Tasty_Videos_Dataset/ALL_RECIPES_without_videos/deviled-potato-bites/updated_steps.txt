Chop 10-15 small yellow potatoes in half, and place on a baking sheet.
Sprinkle with salt, and spray with cooking oil.
Bake at 400˚F (200˚C) for 40 minutes, or until soft.
Scoop out a small section of the potatoes to create a bowl.
(You can add these to the hummus center, or simply snack on them now!)
In a food processor, combine all remaining ingredients.
Blend thoroughly.
Add more water as needed until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
Spoon mixture into a piping bag, and fill the potato cups.
Use a ridged tip on the bag for a beautiful textured effect!
Sprinkle with paprika or seasoning salt and chives.
Enjoy!
