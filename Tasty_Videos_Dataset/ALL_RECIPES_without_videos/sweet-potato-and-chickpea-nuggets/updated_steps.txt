In a small bowl, combine water and flax meal, and let it sit for 10 minutes.
In a large saucepan bring 6 cups (1 ½ L) of water to a boil, add sweet potatoes.
Cook until they are tender, about 10 minutes, and drain.
Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
In a food processor, combine the sweet potatoes, chickpeas, basil, flax meal, garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, and flour, and pulse until combined.
Add the breadcrumbs and mix.
Take about 1 tablespoon worth of mixture and form it into a nugget with your hands.
Pan fry with a small drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Or, you can bake them on a piece of parchment paper at 400˚F (200˚C) for 20 minutes, flipping after the first 10 minutes.
Allow to cool 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
