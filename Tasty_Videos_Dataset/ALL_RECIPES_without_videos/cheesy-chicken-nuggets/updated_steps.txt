First, season the ground chicken with salt and pepper.
Grab a handful of ground chicken and roll into a rough ball shape, place a cube of cheese in the center and wrap the ground chicken around it.
Form it into a chicken nugget shape.
Set aside.
Season the panko with oregano.
Take the chicken nuggets and coat with flour, dip in egg and cover with the panko/oregano mix.
Deep fry in the oil until browned and crispy.
Enjoy!
