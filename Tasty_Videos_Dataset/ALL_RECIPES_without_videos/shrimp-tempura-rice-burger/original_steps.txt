Whisk the egg in a small bowl. Add 120 grams (1 cup) of flour and water. Whisk to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator.
Add flour to a shallow dish. Dip each shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess.
Dip the floured shrimp into the batter.
Heat oil in a pot to 350°F (180˚C).
Fry the shrimp until they float to the top and become golden brown in color. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
For the mayonnaise sauce, combine mayonnaise, ketchup, honey, and vinegar.
Line a ramekin with plastic wrap, and mold ¼ of the rice into a patty. Repeat until you have 6 rice “buns.”
Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a splash of sesame oil. Add the rice “buns” and cook until the outside is crispy, about 5 minutes.
Top the rice "bun" with a piece of green leaf lettuce, fried shrimps, mayonnaise sauce, and top with another rice “bun.” Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Enjoy!
