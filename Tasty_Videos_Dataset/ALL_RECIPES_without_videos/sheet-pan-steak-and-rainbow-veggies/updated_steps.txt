Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
Prepare the vegetables.
Place cherry tomatoes, carrots, yellow bell pepper, red onion, and asparagus evenly on a baking tray.
(Try not to let the vegetables overlap too much, so that they roast properly.)
Season with olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste.
Add garlic cloves and sprigs of thyme on top of the vegetables.
Bake vegetables for 15 minutes.
Roast vegetables for 15 minutes.
Bring back the tray and push vegetables to the side to make room for the steak.
Place the steak in the middle of the pan and season both sides with salt and pepper.
Top the steak with a sprig of thyme and a clove of garlic.
Place back in oven for 10 more minutes or until desired doneness is reached.
Allow the steak to rest for 5-10 minutes.
Plate the vegetables and top with cut steak.
Enjoy!
