Drain and dry the pickled cherry peppers, then cut off the tops and use a teaspoon to scoop out the seeds. Place a mozzarella ball inside of each one.
Make the chicken mixture: In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, egg, Parmesan, milk, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, garlic powder, pepper, and salt. Mix well.
Take a golf ball-size amount of the chicken mixture and pat it out flat in your palm. Place a stuffed cherry pepper in the center and wrap the chicken mixture around it until completely covered, rolling into a ball. Repeat with the remaining cherry peppers.
Chill for 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).
Prepare for frying: Add the bread crumbs to a medium bowl with the Parmesan, dried parsley, garlic powder, and salt. Beat the eggs in a separate medium bowl. Add the flour to another medium bowl.
Toss a chicken meatball in the flour, then coat in the eggs, then roll in the bread crumbs. Repeat with remaining meatballs.
Heat a large pan with ¼ inch (6 ml) of canola oil over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 400°F (200˚C).
Working in batches, fry the chicken meatballs for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until light golden brown. Once finished, blot dry with paper towels and transfer to a greased baking sheet.
Dollop 1 tablespoon of marinara sauce on each ball, then top with a piece of mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 8 minutes, or until meatballs are cooked through with an internal temperature of 165°F (75˚C).
Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
Enjoy!
