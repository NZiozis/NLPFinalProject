Cut the top of an onion and place it cut-side down.
Using a sharp knife make 4 ½-inch (11.5 cm) cuts then go back and make 3 cuts in between each quarter.
Flip the onion over and coax apart its layers or “petals”. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs and the milk.
In large bowl combine flour, paprika, oregano, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper.
Place the onion in it, coating every petal with egg wash.
Place the onion in the dry mixture coating every petal.
Coat the onion in the egg wash and dry mixture one more time.
Heat canola oil to 375ºF (190ºC) in a deep-fryer or dutch oven.
Place onion in the freezer for 10 minutes.
With tongs add the onion to the oil for 2 minutes or until it is browned and crispy.
Move onion to plate covered in paper towels and allow to drain for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine sour cream, salt, pepper, paprika, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, and ketchup.
Enjoy!
