Mix together the ingredients for the Fajita rub.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Toss in the sliced bell peppers and onion, sprinkle over 2 teaspoons of the fajita spice rub, and sauté until soft, about 8 minutes.
Using a sharp knife, carefully slice the chicken breast in half. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap over the chicken breast and flatten the meat with a mallet or rolling pin.
Spread a quarter the sautéed pepper mixture evenly on the chicken breast. Roll the breast and skewer with toothpicks so that the roll holds its shape.
Slice the roll into ½-inch (1¼ cm) pieces, making sure each piece is held together with a toothpick.
Season each roll on both sides with the fajita spice rub.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the skillet and fry the chicken rolls about 3 minutes on each side until fully cooked.
Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
