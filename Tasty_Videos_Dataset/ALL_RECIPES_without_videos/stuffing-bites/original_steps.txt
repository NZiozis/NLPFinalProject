Cook sausage in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion after 1-2 minutes and cook until sausage is cooked and onion is tender.
Remove sausage from heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl and let cool.
Add remaining ingredients to the bowl and mix until thoroughly incorporated.
Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, measure out mixture into 8 evenly sized balls and space them out on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.
Bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for 20 minutes or until bites are cooked and slightly browned on top.
Enjoy!
