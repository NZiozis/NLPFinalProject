In a large bowl, mix together yolks and sugar, while still whisking, add milk
Carefully fold in whipped egg whites.
NOTE: It's better to use a spoon rather than a whisk.
Add and mix the melted butter and the vanilla.
In another large bowl, mix the sieved flour, cocoa powder, and the baking powder.
Form a little well in the middle and pour the milk and eggs mixture. Stir until the batter is smooth.
Mix in the chopped chocolate. Let the batter sit for 15-20 minutes.
To make the ganache, in a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream, without letting it boil.
Take off the heat, mix with the chocolate chips until perfectly smooth.
Over low to medium heat, pour Â¼ cup (60 ml) of pancake batter on a well-oiled pan.
When bubbles start to form on the surface of the pancake, flip and cook it for a minute on the other side.
When the pancakes are ready, pour the chocolate ganache on top.
NOTE: If the ganache has hardened while you were making the pancakes, you can microwave it for 15-20 seconds.
Garnish with raspberries.
Enjoy !
