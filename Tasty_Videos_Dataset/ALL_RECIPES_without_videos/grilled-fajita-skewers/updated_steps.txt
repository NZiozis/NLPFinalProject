Slice onion in quarters, and bell peppers in 1.5" (4cm) squares.
Place each meat in a gallon sized plastic bag and cover with dry ingredients.
Close the bag and shake until evenly coated.
Prepare skewers by layering onion, bell pepper, and protein.
(Be sure not to mix proteins on the same skewer, as they have different cook times.)
Grill the skewers over medium-high heat, flipping once, until the protein’s internal temperatures are as follows: Steak - 155ºF (70ºC), Chicken - 165ºF (75ºC), Shrimp - 145ºF (65ºC).
Enjoy!
