Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a large bowl, combine the ground pork, sage, thyme, maple syrup, salt, pepper, fennel, paprika, and garlic powder.
Mix with your hands until evenly combined.
Divide the sausage mixture evenly between the wells of a 12-cup muffin tin.
Using your fingers, press the mixture against the bottom and up the sides of the cups in an even layer that is flush with the tops of the cups.
Crack 1 egg into each sausage well, then top with tomato slice and season with flaky salt.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the sausage is golden brown and cooked through and the egg is set.
Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.
Serve immediately or cool completely and freeze for up to 1 month.
To reheat, microwave the cups for x minutes, until warmed through.
Enjoy!
