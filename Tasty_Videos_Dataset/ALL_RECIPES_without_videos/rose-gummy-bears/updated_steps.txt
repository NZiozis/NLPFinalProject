Place 1 cup of rosé (240 ml) in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the gelatin powder and remaining rosé wine.
Let sit for 5 minutes.
The gelatin should give off a “blooming” effect, thickening the mixture.
Add the gelatin mixture to the saucepan with the concentrated rosé.
Add the sugar and return the pan to medium-low heat, whisking continuously.
Do not let the mixture boil.
Cook until the gelatin is dissolved, about 5 minutes.
The mixture should have a syrupy consistency, similar to maple syrup.
Remove the pan from the heat.
Add a drop of pink food coloring, if desired.
Use a squeeze bottle, spouted measuring cup, or dropper to distribute the mixture into the gummy bear molds.
If you don’t have a gummy bear mold, pour the mixture into a parchment-lined, 8-inch (20 cm), square baking pan.
Refrigerate for 90 minutes, or until set.
Carefully pop the bears out of the molds or, if using a baking pan, cut into small squares with a pizza cutter.
Store in airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Enjoy!
