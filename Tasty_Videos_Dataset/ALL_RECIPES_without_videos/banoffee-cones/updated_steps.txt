Fold a 45cm (17 ¾ inch) long rectangle of aluminum foil into triangles until you have a triangle with a longest side of 10-12 cm (4-4 ¾ inch).
Form this triangle into a cone.
Make as many aluminum cones as you want.
Cut a sheet of puff pastry into 2.5cm (1 inch) strips.
Wrap the pastry around an aluminum cone so that it overlaps by about 1 cm (⅓ inch).
Press the tail of the pastry onto itself so that it sticks.
Lay this seam face down on a baking sheet and brush with egg wash. Bake for 18-20 minutes at 180°C (350°F).
Whip the double cream.
Reserve 2-3 large scoops of whipped cream.
Mix the remaining whipped cream with the toffee sauce.
Scoop mixture into a plastic bag for piping.
Peel and slice banana.
Remove aluminum cone.
Pipe cones by alternating 2cm (¾ inch) of toffee cream and 1 slice of banana.
Top with a swirl of reserved cream and a vertical banana slice.
Enjoy!
