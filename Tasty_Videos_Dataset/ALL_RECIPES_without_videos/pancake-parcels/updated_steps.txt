Sieve the flour, cocoa powder, icing sugar and salt into a large bowl
Make a well in the centre and whisk in the eggs
Combine the milk and water and slowly add it to the mixture while continuing to whisk.
Melt a small knob of butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat.
Spoon a ladle full of the mixture onto the pan and swirl it around to get a nice thin layer of batter.
Cook for approx.
2.5 minutes and flip the pancake once.
NOTE: You can go for it the cool way, or just use a spatula, weâ€™re not judging you.
;)
Cook further for 60 more seconds and remove from the heat.
Pour the frozen raspberries into a pot and cook, along with 3 tbsp of water on the lowest setting with the lid on for 5-6 minutes.
(You can also use fresh raspberries with 5-6 tbsp of water.)
Spoon a dollop of ice cream into the center of the pancake, and pour over a few spoons of the raspberries.
Wrap the pancake up around the ice cream and use a strawberry lace to tie it all together.
Enjoy!
