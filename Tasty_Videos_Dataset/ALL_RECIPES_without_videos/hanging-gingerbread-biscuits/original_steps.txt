Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Beat the butter and brown sugar together until fully mixed.
Add 1 egg and mix until smooth. Set aside.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and spices into a large bowl.
Add the butter mixture made earlier and incorporate until a stiff dough is formed.
Roll out between two pieces of clingfilm until about 3 mm (⅛ inch) thick. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Cut out the shapes you would like with a cookie cutter and place on a baking tray lined with paper.
Use a small cocktail stick to create a small hole in each biscuit for the ribbon.
Bake for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Cool on the tray for two minutes, opening up the hole again if closed while baking.
Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
Decorate with chocolate or icing sugar, and use string/ribbon to hang off your tree.
Enjoy!
