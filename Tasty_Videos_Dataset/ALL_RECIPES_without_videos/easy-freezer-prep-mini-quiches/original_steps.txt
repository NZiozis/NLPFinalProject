Preheat oven to 375ºF (190ºC), and lightly grease a 12-cup nonstick muffin tin.
Cut the pie crusts into 12 circles, 4½ inches (12 cm) in diameter.
Press pie crust circles into the muffin tin cups.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Mix the ingredients for the broccoli cheddar.
Mix the ingredients for the onion and pepper.
Mix the ingredients for the tomato and goat cheese.
Pour each filling over their own row of 4 crusts.
Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until filling is fully cooked and no longer runny.
After removing from the oven, run a butter knife or thin spatula around each cup to prevent crust from sticking to the sides.
Eat while still warm, or cool, then freeze in an airtight container for up to 1 month. To reheat, microwave for 60-90 seconds.
Enjoy!
