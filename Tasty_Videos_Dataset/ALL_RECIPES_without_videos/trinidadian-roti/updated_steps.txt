In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until fully incorporated.
Slowly add the water until the mixture forms a dough.
Divide the dough into roughly 12 loyas (balls), cover with a dish towel, and let rest for about 30 minutes.
Sprinkle each ball with flour and flatten or roll out into a circle roughly 5 inches (12-cm) in diameter.
Spread ghee on each round and make a cut from the center out to the edge, then roll to make a cone.
Press the peak and flatten the center of the cone.
Let rest for another 30 minutes.
On a floured surface, roll each ball into a circle roughly 8 inches (20-cm) in diameter.
Heat a tawah or flat frying pan over medium-high heat.
Coat with oil and place a round of dough on the pan.
Cook the dough until light brown, watching carefully, about 5 minutes.
Then flip and cook on the other side, about 3-4 minutes more.
Repeat with the remaining dough rounds.
Break up the cooked roti with your hands or serve whole.
Serve the fried roti with the fillings.
Enjoy!
