Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering.
Add the onion and saute for about 3 minutes, until translucent.
Add the garlic and saute for about 2 minutes, until fragrant.
Add the curry powder, paprika, cayenne, cumin, allspice, ginger, salt, and pepper.
Stir and cook for about 2 minutes until the spices are fragrant.
Add the potatoes and mix well until well-coated in spices.
Add the chickpeas and stir to incorporate.
Add the broth, lemon juice, and tomatoes and stir, then pour in the coconut milk and stir to combine.
Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a simmer.
Once bubbling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a fork.
Serve with cooked rice and naan and garnish with fresh cilantro.
Enjoy!
