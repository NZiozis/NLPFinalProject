Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Cut pizza dough into 8 sections on a floured surface.
With one section, roll out dough until flat and circular.
Layer one slice mozzarella cheese, two tablespoons spinach, and 1 tablespoon ricotta.
Fold one side of dough up and over ingredients, and seal calzone by crimping the edges together.
In a small bowl, mix together melted butter, parmesan, garlic, and parsley.
Place calzone on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Apply egg wash to outside of calzone and brush with garlic butter.
Bake calzones for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
