Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚F).
Place potatoes in a single layer onto one of a greased baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, garlic, Italian seasoning, and Parmesan, gently tossing to combine.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp, tossing occasionally.
Preheat oven to broil.
Season steaks with salt and pepper, to taste, and place onto the opposite side of the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
Place into oven and broil until the steak is browned and charred at the edges, about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until desired doneness.
Serve immediately with garlic butter, and top with parsley. Enjoy!
