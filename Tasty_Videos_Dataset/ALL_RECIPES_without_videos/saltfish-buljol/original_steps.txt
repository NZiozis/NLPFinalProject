Break the fish in pieces, removing any bones, and place in large saucepan with the water and lemons. Boil over medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes.
Taste the fish at this point to check the salt level. If it is still too salty, repeat step 1.
Drain and shred the fish with your fingers.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, scallions, bell peppers, tomatoes, and parsley, and cook for 1-2 minutes.
Add the saltfish and cook for another 5 minutes.
Season with black pepper and lime juice, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with sliced avocado.
Enjoy!
