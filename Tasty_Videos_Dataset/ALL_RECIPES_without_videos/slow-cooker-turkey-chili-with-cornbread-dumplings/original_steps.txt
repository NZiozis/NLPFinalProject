Combine the ground turkey, onion, bell peppers, garlic, crushed tomatoes, black and pinto beans, corn, chili powder, pepper, and salt in the bowl of a slow cooker.
Cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 4 hours.
Once the chili has cooked for 6-8 hours, make the dumplings: Combine the eggs, melted butter, milk, and brown sugar in a large bowl.
Add the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt and stir until smooth. Fold in the cheese.
Using a small ice cream scoop, dollop the batter on top of the chili and cook for 2 more hours on low or 1 hour on high, until the dumplings are puffed and tender.
If using, garnish the chili with jalape√±o, cilantro, and green onions.
Enjoy!
