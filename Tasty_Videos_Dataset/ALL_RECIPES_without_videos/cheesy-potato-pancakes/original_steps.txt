Using a box grater, shred the potatoes into a towel in a bowl and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.
Set aside and grate the onion.
Add the grated potatoes and grated onion onion to a large bowl. Add in the eggs, garlic, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cheddar cheese, monterey jack, and breadcrumbs and mix until combined.
Take ½ cup of the potato mixture and form into a thin patty, about ⅓-inch thick.
Heat cooking oil over medium-high heat and place potato patty into the skillet. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy on the outside. Repeat with remaining patties.
Serve with sour cream and green onions on top, and enjoy!
Enjoy!
