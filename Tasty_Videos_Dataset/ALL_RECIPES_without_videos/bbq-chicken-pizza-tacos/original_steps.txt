Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut the chicken breasts into ¾-inch (2 cm) cubes and transfer to a medium bowl. Add the salt, paprika, pepper, garlic powder, barbecue sauce, and honey, and mix with your hands until the chicken is well-coated.
Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat.
Add the chicken and cook for 10 minutes, or until golden and charred on the edges. Remove the pan from the heat.
Place the tortillas side by side on the baking sheet with the edges overlapping slightly.
Sprinkle the shredded cheese, red onion, bacon, cooked chicken, and parsley evenly over the tortillas.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted. Serve warm.
Enjoy!
