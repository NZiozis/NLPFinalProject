Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
Slice the jalapeños in half, then remove the seeds by scraping out the insides.
Spread the cream cheese evenly among the jalapeño shells.
Wrap each jalapeño in bacon.
Place the bacon-wrapped jalapeños on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20 minutes, until bacon is browned and peppers are tender.
Enjoy!
