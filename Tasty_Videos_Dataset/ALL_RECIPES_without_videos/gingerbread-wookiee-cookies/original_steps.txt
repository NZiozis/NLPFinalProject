Combine all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Once dough begins to form a ball in the center.
Dust generously with flour.
Separate into three sections to make rolling easier. Cover dough with plastic wrap or wax paper.
Chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
Dust a smooth surface with flour, and roll out a section of the dough to about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick. Use a gingerbread man cookie cutter, or a knife to slice out your Wookiees.
Wookiees are tall, so you may want to stretch out the head and feet! Place on parchment paper on a baking sheet, and score the cookie’s surface to look like fur.
Bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for 10-12 min. Your Wookiees will puff up quickly!
Melt the chocolate and put into a piping bag.
Add the bandolier, eyes and nose.
Serve these soft and *chewie* Wookiee cookies
Enjoy!
