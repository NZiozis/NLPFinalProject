Microwave the tortillas on a plate until slightly crispy. They will dry out a bit as they cool.
Mix the chicken, peppers, and taco seasoning in a bowl until evenly combined, then cook for about 1-2 minutes until the peppers are soft.
Spread the mixture evenly on one tortilla, cover evenly with the cheese, then top with the other tortilla.
Cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, slice, then serve.
Enjoy!
