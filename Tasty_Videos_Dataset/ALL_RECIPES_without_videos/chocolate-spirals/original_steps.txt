Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch by 14-inch (30 cm by 35 cm) rectangle.
Use a spatula to spread the chocolate hazelnut spread over half of the pastry. Fold other half of the pastry over the chocolate spread.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Slice lengthwise into twelve ½-inch (1 cm) wide strips.
Hold the top of a strip with one hand and use your other hand to twist. Once the twist goes all the way up the strip, roll into a tight spiral. Repeat with the rest of the strips.
Transfer the spirals to the prepared baking sheet and brush with egg wash.
Bake for 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
