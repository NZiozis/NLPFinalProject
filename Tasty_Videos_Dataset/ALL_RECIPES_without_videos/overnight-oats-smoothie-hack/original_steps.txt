In a mason jar or sealable container, add the oats, almond milk, yogurt, almond butter, honey, chia seeds, cinnamon, and peaches. Make sure the oats and almond milk are at the bottom of the container so that they properly soak.
Seal and place in the refrigerator overnight.
Enjoy as is, or pour the ingredients into a blender with the additional almond milk and blend until smooth.
Pour the mixture back into the mason jar and take your overnight oats on the go.
Enjoy!
