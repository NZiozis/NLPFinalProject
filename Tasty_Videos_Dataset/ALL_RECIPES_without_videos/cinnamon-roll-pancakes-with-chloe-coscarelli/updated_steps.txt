In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the almond milk and maple syrup.
Add the wet ingredient to the dry and whisk to combine.
Do not overmix.
In a small bowl, mix together the margarine, brown sugar, and cinnamon.
Transfer to a pastry bag or plastic zip-top bag and snip off one corner.
Lightly grease a large nonstick skillet or griddle and heat over medium heat.
When the pan shimmers, measure out ¼ cup (35 g) of the batter (or eyeball it) and pour it onto the skillet.
Pipe a circular swirl of the cinnamon mixture into the batter.
Repeat to fill the skillet.
When small bubbles appear in the center of the pancakes, after about 4 minutes, flip.
Cook on the other side for about 1 minute more, until lightly browned and cooked through.
Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the skillet between batches as needed.
In a small bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar and water and whisk until smooth.
Drizzle the pancakes with the glaze and serve.
Enjoy!
