Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Add olive oil and butter to a skillet on medium-high heat.
Once warmed, add the carrot, onion, celery, and garlic.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 10-12 minutes.
Once the vegetables have caramelized, add in the ground beef, pork, salt, pepper, and tomato paste.
Stir to combine, breaking up the pieces of meat, until the meat has browned, 15-20 minutes.
Once the sauce is dark brown and starting to stick slightly to the bottom of the pan, add the red wine.
Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release all the cooked brown bits.
Once the wine comes to a simmer, add in the diced canned tomatoes, and stir to combine.
Bring the sauce to a simmer, cover with a lid, and cook for at least 30 minutes (the longer the better!)
stirring occasionally, and then set aside.
In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta, basil, Parmesan, parsley, egg, salt, and pepper.
Set aside.
In a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) glass baking pan, add a layer of bolognese to the bottom.
Top with noodles, then spread a layer of ricotta.
Repeat with another layer of bolognese, noodles, ricotta, noodles, bolognese, extra mozzarella, and Parmesan.
Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
Remove the foil and bake again for an additional 15 minutes until the cheese on top has browned and the bolognese is bubbling.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
