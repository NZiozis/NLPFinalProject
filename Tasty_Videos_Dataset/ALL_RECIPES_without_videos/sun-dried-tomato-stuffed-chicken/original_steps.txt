Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F, Gas Mark 6).
Dice the mozzarella and sun-dried tomatoes into small pieces and tear the basil leaves.
Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and dried oregano.
Cut a very deep slit lengthways into the chicken, but do not cut all the way through - spread it out a bit if necessary to give you more room to work with.
Stuff to the brim with the fillings
Use a few cocktail sticks to hold the chicken together and place on a baking tray.
Pour a tablespoon of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes jar over each chicken breast.
Bake in the center of the oven for 20-25 minutes until cooked through and the juices run clear.
Remove the cocktail sticks.
Enjoy!
