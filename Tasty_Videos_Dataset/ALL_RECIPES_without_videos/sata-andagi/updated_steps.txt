Fill a deep pot or skillet with enough oil to come 2 inches (5 cm) from the top of the pan.
Heat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 350°F (180°C).
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.
Stir in the eggs, milk, and orange juice.
Mix until a thick batter forms.
Add the orange zest and mix to incorporate.
Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop ping pong ball-size dough balls into the hot oil.
Fry for about 5-7 minutes, or until golden brown.
The doughnuts should float to the surface when they are done.
Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Serve hot.
Enjoy!
