Fill a large stock-pot with water and bring to a boil.
Carefully submerge mason jars with their tops in the boiling water and keep them submerged for at least 5 minutes until ready to use.
Combine brine ingredients in a medium-sized saucepan and bring to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer and allow brine to simmer for 2-4 minutes before removing from heat.
Thoroughly wash all herbs and vegetables (cucumbers in this case) you intend to pickle before cutting them into the desired shape and size.
Carefully place and arrange the herbs and vegetables inside of the mason jar.
Pour the warm brine over the vegetables until the mason jar is just about full, making sure to completely submerge the items you want to get pickled.
Seal the jar while the brine is still warm and allow to cool completely before placing in the fridge.
The pickles will reach their peak readiness in 10 days to 2 weeks and can be stored for up to two months.
Enjoy!
