In a large bowl, combine flour, eggs, butter, and sugar, stirring until ingredients are slightly mixed.
Add the milk ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring vigorously, making sure the milk is completely incorporated into the batter and that the batter is smooth before adding more milk.
Repeat with the rest of the milk.
The batter should be very liquidy and have no lumps.
In a pan over medium heat, pour ⅓ cup (95 g) of the batter in the center and swirl the batter around the edges of the pan until set.
To know when the crepe is ready to flip, lift up one of the edges about ⅓ of the way.
The bottom side should be golden brown.
Flip the crepe.
Cook until the edges are starting to slightly crisp.
Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel to make sure the crepes stay moist.
In a pot over medium heat, combine all the berries with the lemon juice and the sugar, stirring until the mixture comes to a boil.
Cook for about 2 minutes, then remove from heat and cool completely.
Mix the cream cheese with the powdered sugar until smooth.
Spread half of the cream cheese mixture on one side of the crepe.
Spread half of the berries on top of the cream cheese.
Fold the crepe over the berries, then fold in half.
Repeat with the other crepe.
Serve with powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
