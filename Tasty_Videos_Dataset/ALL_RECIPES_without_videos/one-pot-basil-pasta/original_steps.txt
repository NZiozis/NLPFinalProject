Place all of the ingredients except for the parmesan into a large pot. Cook on a high heat for 2 minutes, submerging the spaghetti into the water once itâ€™s softened enough.
Lower the temperature to a medium/low heat and toss and stir continuously until the liquid reduces down into a thick sauce. serve with more fresh basil and top with parmesan.
Enjoy!
