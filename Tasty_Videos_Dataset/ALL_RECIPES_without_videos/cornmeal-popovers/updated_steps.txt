In a large bowl, combine the eggs, melted butter, salt, and milk.
Whisk well.
Sift in the flour and cornmeal and slowly whisk to incorporate.
Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Place 2 12-cup muffin tins in the oven as it preheats.
Remove the hot muffin tins from the oven and brush with butter, then return to the oven for 5 minutes.
Remove the muffin tins from the oven and distribute the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling them almost to the rim.
Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) and bake for 15 minutes more, until the popovers are lightly browned and puffed.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
