Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Cut the avocados in half and carefully remove the pits.
Scoop out 1-2 tablespoons of avocado from the center of each half (save it for another meal!).
Transfer the avocado halves to a baking sheet and carefully crack an egg into each avocado cup.
If the divot is too small, it may be easier to separate the egg yolks and whites before placing them in the avocado.
Add your favorite topping combo, such as tomato and basil, feta cheese, bell pepper and onion, and bacon and chives.
Season with salt and pepper to taste
Bake for 18 minutes, or until the egg whites have cooked completely.
Enjoy!
