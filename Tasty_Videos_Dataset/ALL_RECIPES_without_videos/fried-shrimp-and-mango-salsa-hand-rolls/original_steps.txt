Mix the mango salsa. In a mixing bowl, combine the mango, red onion, bell pepper, avocado, lime juice, and olive oil, salt and pepper to taste, and cilantro. Then, set aside.
Next, it’s time to season the rice. In a large mixing bowl, mix the cooked rice with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Set that mixture aside.
Prepare the shrimp for deep-frying. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper. Coat the shrimp in flour, then eggs and, lastly, panko.
Fry in oil until crispy and golden brown.
Finally, it’s time to make the hand rolls. First, place the nori sheet in your left hand. Second, spread some rice in the left third of the nori sheet. Then, layer on a few of the fried shrimp, spoon some of the mango salsa over and roll into a cone shape.
Enjoy!
