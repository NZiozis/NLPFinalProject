In a food processor, or by hand, crush ½ a box of Triscuits.
Set aside.
Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large bowl.
Pinch off bite sized balls of filling and roll between your hands (about 1 oz or 28g each).
Roll the balls in the crushed Triscuit mixture, then coat it in beaten egg, then again in Triscuit mixture.
Heat a sauce pan of vegetable oil to 350˚F (180˚C).
Line a tray with paper towel to drain the fried bites.
Fry each bite until Triscuit coating turns a light brown, about 45 seconds.
NOTE: If they’re fried too long, the cheese filling will escape and you’ll be left with a sad shell of a former cheese bite.
Garnish with more chopped dill and a squeeze of lemon.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
