Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Fold the parchment paper in half, then open up.
Lay down the salmon. Drizzle oil and sprinkle salt and pepper. Lay lemon slices and thyme on top of the salmon.
Fold the parchment paper over the salmon, and cinch the paper together by folding it over itself along the edges.
Bake for 13-15 minutes or until internal temperature of salmon reaches 145˚F (65˚C).
Enjoy!
