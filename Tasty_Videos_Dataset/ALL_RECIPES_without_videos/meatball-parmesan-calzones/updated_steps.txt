Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Cut pizza dough into 8 sections on a floured surface.
With one section, roll out dough until flat and circular.
Spread 1 tablespoon of marinara on flattened dough.
Wrap up two meatballs in a slice of mozzarella and place them in the center of the dough.
Sprinkle with ½ tablespoon parmesan cheese and some fresh basil.
Fold one side of dough up and over ingredients, and seal calzone by crimping the edges together.
Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Apply egg wash to outside of calzone and sprinkle with black pepper.
Bake calzones for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
