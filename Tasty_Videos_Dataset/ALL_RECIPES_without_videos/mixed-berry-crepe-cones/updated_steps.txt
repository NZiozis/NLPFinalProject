Make the crepes by sifting the flour, salt, and sugar and then slowly stir in the egg, and butter.
Slowly add the milk into the mixture.
In a nonstick pan over medium heat, pour in ⅓ cup (80ml) of the batter and turn it to cover the whole surface.
Cook until the bottom is brown and flip.
Repeat until you’re all out of crepe batter.
Set the crepes aside to cool.
Lay out a crepe and spread the berries in a quarter section.
Fold the crepe in half and then slowly roll it into a cone.
Top with more berries if desired, whipped cream, and powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
