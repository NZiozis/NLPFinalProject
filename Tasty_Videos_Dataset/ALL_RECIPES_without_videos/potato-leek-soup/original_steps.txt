Melt butter on medium heat in a large pot. Add the chopped leeks and stir until coated with butter.
Cover the pot and lower heat, cook for around 10 minutes until the leeks have softened.
Increase to medium-high. Add garlic, potatoes, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute, then add vegetable broth, water, thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil.
Lower heat and cover pot with a lid and simmer for 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and easily speared by a fork.
Uncover and remove thyme and bay leaf.
Use an immersion or countertop blender to blend the soup until smooth.
Stir in chives and hot sauce (optional).
Allow to cool 2 minutes and serve.
Enjoy!
