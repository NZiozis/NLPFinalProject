Cut the salmon into bite-size cubes.
Set aside.
Prepare the marinade by mixing the soy sauce, lemon juice, ginger, chilli, garlic, and sea salt together.
Mix the salmon into the marinade, cover, and marinate for 15-30 minutes.
In a large pan with a little oil, pour in the marinade and add the honey and sesame seeds.
Mix together until it starts to bubble and gets thicker/saucier.
Add the salmon and fry for a couple of minutes on each side.
Take off the heat and garnish with more sesame seeds, spring onion, red chilli, and cocktail sticks.
Enjoy!
