Place a slice of bread in a preheated, greased waffle iron.
Spread the eggs evenly on top.
Sprinkle the chives over the eggs.
Top with the ham, followed by the cheese.
Place the second slice of bread on top.
Cook for 3-5 minutes, until cheese is melted and the bread is golden brown, then serve.
Enjoy!
