Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Place the slices of bacon in the muffin tin wrapping in a circle.
Bake the bacon for 10 minutes.
Crack one egg into each of the cups and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cheddar cheese.
Bake again for another 10 minutes or until egg yolk is at desired consistency.
Run a knife around the edge of each cup to loosen and remove.
Sprinkle with chives, if desired.
Enjoy!
