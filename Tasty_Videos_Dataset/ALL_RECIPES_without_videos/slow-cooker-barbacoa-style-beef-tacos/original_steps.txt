Cut the beef into 6-8 large chunks. Season all over with pepper and salt.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the beef, in batches if necessary, on all sides, until browned. Transfer the seared meat to a slow cooker.
In a medium bowl, combine the chipotles, garlic, cumin, oregano, cloves, salt, pepper, beef broth, apple cider vinegar, and lime juice. Mix well.
Pour the marinade over the beef in the slow cooker and add the bay leaves. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours, until the meat can be shredded easily.
Remove and discard the bay leaves. Remove and shred the beef, then return to the slow cooker to marinate in the sauce for at least 10 more minutes, or until ready to serve.
To serve, add the shredded beef to your choice of tortillas with your favorite toppings.
Enjoy!
