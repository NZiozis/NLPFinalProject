Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Remove excess moisture from chicken wings with a paper towel.
In a large bowl, stir in baking powder and salt until chicken is thoroughly coated.
Bake on a baking rack for 1 hour, or until golden brown and crispy, flipping every 20 minutes.
(For best results, place baking rack on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper or foil to catch drippings).
In a skillet, heat olive oil and garlic on medium heat for about 30 seconds, or until garlic starts to release its flavor.
Stir in remaining herbs and spices.
Once combined, add in chicken wings and stir until fully coated.
Serve with your favorite side dish or dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
