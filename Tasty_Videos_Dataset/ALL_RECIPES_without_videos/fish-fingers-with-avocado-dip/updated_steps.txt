Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Cut white fish fillets into 3x4-inch (8x10 cm) long strips.
Set aside.
In a small bowl, combine bread crumbs, parsley, and lemon zest.
Place the flour and eggs in two separate bowls.
Coat each fish strip with the flour, then eggs, and then bread crumbs.
Transfer strips to a baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes, flipping halfway and until golden brown.
Combine the avocados, yogurt, lime juice, olive oil, cilantro, salt, and pepper in a food processor and blend until smooth.
Serve baked fish fingers with avocado dip.
Enjoy!
