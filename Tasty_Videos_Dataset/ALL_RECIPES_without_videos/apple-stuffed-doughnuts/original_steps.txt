For the batter, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
Mix in the egg and buttermilk.
Gradually stir in the milk.
Next, core the apples and slice vertically into doughnut-size rings. Each apple should give you about 3 rings.
Heat the oil in a deep frying pan to 180˚C (350°F).
Coat each apple ring in the batter.
Carefully lay the doughnuts into the oil and fry for a few minutes on each side, until golden brown.
Drain on paper towel before coating in sugar.
Enjoy!
