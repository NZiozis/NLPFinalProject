Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Carefully separate 6 eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and the the whites in a medium size bowl.
Place the 2 whole eggs in the large bowl with the yolks and add the oil. 4. Beat together with a fork or whisk until smooth.
Add the almond flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt to the egg yolk mixture. Stir the mixture with a spatula until well incorporated and set aside.
Add the cream of tartar to the egg whites and beat with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form.
Use a rubber spatula to transfer ⅓ of the whipped egg whites to the almond mixture and gently fold the batter together.
Add the next ⅓ of the whites to the batter and fold in until smooth.
Gently fold in the remaining egg whites just until the batter is smooth and no white streaks remain.
Line the bottom of an ungreased loaf pan with parchment paper and pour in the batter.
Bake for 40 minutes, until the top has set and formed a golden crust.
Let the loaf cool for 10 minutes before running a thin knife along the inside of the pan to release the sides of the loaf. Gently unmold the loaf from the pan and remove the parchment paper on the bottom.
Let the cake cool at room temperature for 1 hour before slicing.
Enjoy!
