Peel the cucumbers. Cut into discs, and then quarter the discs. Place in a large salad bowl.
Cut tomatoes into quarters, lengthwise, and then rotate and cut into large chunks. Add to the salad bowl.
Cut the red onion in half, removing the skin, stem, and bottom. Thinly slice and add to the bowl.
Add the feta cheese, olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and olives to the salad bowl and toss gently.
Enjoy!
