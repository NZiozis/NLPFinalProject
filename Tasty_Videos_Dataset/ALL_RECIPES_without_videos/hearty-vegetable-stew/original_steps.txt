In large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes, or until most of their juices have been released.
Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until onions are semi-translucent.
Add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, pepper, tomato paste, and soy sauce, and cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the herbs are fragrant.
Add the flour and stir until fully incorporated. Add the wine and stir until mostly absorbed.
Add the potatoes, vegetable broth, and bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and the stew has thickened.
Remove the bay leaves.
Enjoy!
