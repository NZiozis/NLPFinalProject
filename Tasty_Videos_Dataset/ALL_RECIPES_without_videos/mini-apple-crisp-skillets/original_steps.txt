Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a small bowl, mix together the cake mix and 2 tablespoons of melted butter until the mixture is crumbly.
Pour 1 tablespoon of melted butter into the bottom of two small cast-iron skillets.
Arrange the apple slices in each skillet, ensuring the bottom is covered.
Sprinkle cake mixture over the apples.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until top appears crispy and edges are bubbling.
Cool for 10 minutes.
Enjoy!
