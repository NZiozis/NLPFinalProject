In a medium skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the kale and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-wilted. Season with a pinch of salt.
Add a splash of water and continue to cook for 3-4 minutes until the kale is mostly wilted.
Add another drizzle of olive oil and the garlic, pine nuts, and red pepper flakes to the pan. Cook for another 3-4 minutes until the garlic is fragrant and the pine nuts are toasted.
Add the sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 2-3 more minutes until the kale is completely wilted and tender. Transfer the kale mixture to a bowl and set aside.
In the same pan, add a drizzle of oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes. Heat the flatbreads, 1 at a time, for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown.
Transfer the flatbreads to a cutting board and spread with the hummus. Spoon the kale mixture on top and cut into quarters.
Sprinkle with more red pepper flakes, if desired, and serve.
Enjoy!
