In a large pitcher, combine the strawberries, orange slices, pineapples, peach schnapps, and sparkling water.
Stir and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.
When ready to serve, remove the pitcher from the refrigerator and add the champagne.
Gently stir to combine.
Place 1-2 small scoops of orange sorbet in a glass.
Pour the sangria over the sorbet and stir with a spoon.
Garnish with an orange slice.
Enjoy!
