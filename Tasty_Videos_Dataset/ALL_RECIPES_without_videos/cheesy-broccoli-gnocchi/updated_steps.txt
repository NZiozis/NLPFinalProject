Preheat the oven to 180째C (350째F).
Bring some water to the boil in a saucepan and boil the runner beans and broccoli for 2-3 minutes.
Take them out of the water and set aside.
In the same boiling water, cook the gnocchi for 2 minutes (or, until it floats to the top of the water).
Drain.
In the same saucepan, mix together the drained gnocchi, runner beans, broccoli, mozzarella, parmesan, cream, and pepper.
Pour into an ovenproof dish and bake for 5 minutes at 180째C (350째F), until the cheese bubbles.
Enjoy!
