In a medium mixing bowl combine the brownie mix, oil and water. Mix well.
On a baking sheet, lay down a sheet of wax paper. Spoon on half the mixture, and spread out to be about ½ inch (1 cm) thick.
Press 6 gram crackers into the mixture. Cover with remaining brownie batter.
Bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for 15-20 minutes until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Let it cool before slicing out the graham crackers. (There will be leftover bits of brownie in between the slices to enjoy now! Mmmm. )
Freeze the rectangular slices for one hour.
Peel and slice 3 bananas before freezing.
In a blender, combine the bananas, vanilla, and maple syrup. Blend on high until creamy.
Use a bag to squeeze the filling onto the crust. Top with another crust.
Enjoy!
