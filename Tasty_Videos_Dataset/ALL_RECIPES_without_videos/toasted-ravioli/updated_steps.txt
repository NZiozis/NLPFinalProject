If your ravioli is frozen, allow to thaw before breading.
Dredge the ravioli in flour, then egg wash (allow excess to drip off), then bread crumbs.
Fill a large pot or skillet with 2 inches (5 cm) of oil and bring up to 350°F (180°C).
Carefully place ravioli in the oil (don’t crowd them - cook in batches) and let cook for about 1 minute per side until golden brown.
Set aside on a plate covered with paper towels to drain excess oil.
Once the ravioli have cooled, plate and serve with warm marinara sauce.
Enjoy!
