Add cauliflower florets and salt to a bowl and microwave for 5-7 minutes, or until the florets become soft.
Add flour, cornstarch, paprika, cayenne pepper, 2 cloves of minced garlic, salt, ginger, and 1 teaspoon soy sauce to a bowl.
Mix until well combined.
Add water to the bowl in small amounts until the batter is thick and smooth.
Add the cauliflower and mix until fully coated.
Heat oil in a pot to 425°F (220°C).
Add the coated cauliflower florets and deep fry until golden brown.
Transfer the fried cauliflower to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with salt.
In a cup or small bowl, make the cornstarch slurry.
Combine the water and cornstarch and mix until well combined.
In a large pan, heat oil and saute garlic on medium high heat.
Add the green onions and saute for 2-3 minutes.
Add the bell peppers and sauté for 7 minutes, or until the peppers are soft.
Add the vinegar, chili sauce, tomato sauce, soy sauce, and crushed pepper flakes, and mix well.
Add small amounts of the cornstarch water to the mixture and stir until the water becomes translucent.
Add as much as you’d like, depending on how much gravy you want, but only go up to ½ cup (120 ml) of water to 4 tablespoons of cornstarch for maximum flavor.
Add the fried cauliflower and gently stir to coat it with the gravy.
Add salt to taste and stir.
Serve with rice and top with optional lemon juice.
Enjoy!
