Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
Core apples and cut into ¼-inch slices, then cut those slices in half width-wise.
In a large bowl, combine apples and all filling ingredients.
Stir well and transfer to a 13x9 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
For the topping - in a separate bowl, combine all topping ingredients and mash together with a fork until it forms into small and medium-sized clumps.
Sprinkle the topping evenly over the apples.
Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the liquid has thickened and the apples are tender.
Cool for 10 minutes and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
Enjoy!
