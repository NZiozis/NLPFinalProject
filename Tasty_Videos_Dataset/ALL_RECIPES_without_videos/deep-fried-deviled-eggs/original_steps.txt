Heat cooking oil for deep-frying in a medium-size pan over medium heat.
Cut the hard-boiled eggs in half lengthwise. Gently separate the cooked egg white from the yolk and remove to a medium bowl.
Coat the cooked egg white in flour, eggs, and panko bread crumbs. Carefully place eggs into the hot oil.
Fry for 2-3 minutes, flipping halfway through.
Remove from pan and drain excess oil on a paper towel.
Add mayonnaise, relish, mustard, hot sauce, salt, and pepper to the yolks and mash until smooth.
Fill a piping bag or plastic sandwich bag with yolk mixture. Pipe mixture back into the fried egg white and dust with paprika.
Enjoy!
