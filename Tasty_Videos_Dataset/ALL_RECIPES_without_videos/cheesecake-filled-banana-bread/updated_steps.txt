Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a medium bowl, mash bananas.
Mix eggs, brown sugar, white sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and yogurt into the mixture.
Add flour, salt, and baking soda and mix until well combined.
To prepare the cream cheese filling, mix egg, cream cheese, sugar, and flour in a small bowl.
Pour half the banana batter into a greased 9x5-inch (23x12 cm) bread pan.
Pour cream cheese filling evenly over the banana batter.
Pour the remaining banana batter on top of the cream cheese filling.
Bake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean from the middle of the bread.
(Baking times may vary, so keep an eye on the bread.)
Allow to cool for 15 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
