Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut the sweet potato into ⅛-inch to ¼-inch (3- to 6-mm) slices. In a medium bowl, toss the sweet potato slices with olive oil until fully coated. Add the seasonings and toss to coat. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet without overlapping the potatoes.
Bake for 25 - 35 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown. Let the slices cool to room temperature.
Enjoy!
