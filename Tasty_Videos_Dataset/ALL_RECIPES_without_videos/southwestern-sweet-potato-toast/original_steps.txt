Cut the sweet potato lengthwise into slices, about Â¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
Place the slices in the toaster and set it to the maximum cook time. When it pops, flip the sweet potato slices over and toast again. Depending on the strength of your toaster and your preferences, you may need to toast once more. Remove the slices from the toaster and let cool enough to handle.
Mash the avocado. Add salt and pepper to taste and mix until well-combined.
Spread the mashed avocado evenly across the sweet potato toast and top with corn salsa. Drizzle with hot sauce.
Enjoy!
