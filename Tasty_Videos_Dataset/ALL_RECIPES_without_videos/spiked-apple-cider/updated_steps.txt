Add the apple cider, cinnamon sticks, and allspice berries to a slow cooker.
Turn the heat setting to high, cover, and warm for 30-60 minutes, or until steaming.
Once steaming, reduce the heat setting to warm.
Add the apples and rum and stir to combine.
Ladle into mugs and garnish with cinnamon sticks.
Enjoy!
