Mix together all of the spices and seasoning
Rub it onto the pork shoulder, make sure you get really stuck in there and all over the pork.
Place the pork shoulder into a slow cooker and gently pour over the cider.
Put the lid on and cook on low for 8-12 hours.
Move the pork into a large bowl and shred using two forks.
We used toasted brioche buns and coleslaw, but you could add some bbq sauce or whatever you feel like.
Enjoy!
