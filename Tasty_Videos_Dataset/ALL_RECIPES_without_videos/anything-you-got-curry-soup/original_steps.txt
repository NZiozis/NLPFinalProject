Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper, cook for about 3 minutes, until the onions begin to soften and become aromatic.
Add the brown sugar, turmeric, and curry paste and stir to coat the aromatics. Cook until the mixture is fragrant and begins to simmer, about 5 minutes.
Add the potatoes and coconut milk. Stir to combine and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with whatever vegetables and herbs you have on hand.
Enjoy!
