Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Add the walnuts and pepitas to the prepared baking sheet. Toast in the oven for 10 minutes, until golden brown and fragrant.
In a medium bowl, mix together the toasted walnuts and pepitas, chia seeds, figs, flaxseeds, oats, pumpkin spice, and salt.
In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, almond milk, olive oil, and maple syrup.
Then, add the flaxseed meal and dry ingredients and stir with a spatula to incorporate. The “dough” will be moist and somewhat loose.
Transfer the batter to a 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan, packing it into the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes. The loaf will become very browned during baking. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15-20 minutes before slicing.
