Preheat your oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
In a cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat, add the cherries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt.
Mix to combine and stir for 5-10 minutes until the mixture starts to thicken.
Let simmer for 5 minutes on low heat.
Sprinkle the box cake mix over the cherry filling.
Distribute the butter evenly over the top to ensure even baking.
Bake for 45 minutes to an hour, until the top is golden brown.
Serve warm with ice cream.
Enjoy!
