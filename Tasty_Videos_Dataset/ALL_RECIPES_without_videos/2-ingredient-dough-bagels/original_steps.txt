Preheat oven to 400°F(200°C).
In a large bowl, mix the self-rising flour and greek yogurt until it comes together to form a ball.
Transfer the dough ball to a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to begin flattening and shaping the rough into a roughly 8-inch (20 cm) disk.
Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into 4 equal pieces.
One at a time, roll each piece of dough into a log roughly 8 inches (20 cm) long. Shape the log into a ring and transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Brush the tops of the bagels with egg wash and sprinkle generously with everything seasoning.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the bagels are golden brown.
Enjoy!
