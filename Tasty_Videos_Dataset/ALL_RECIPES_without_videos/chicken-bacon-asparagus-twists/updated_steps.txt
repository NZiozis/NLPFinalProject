Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
On a cutting board, slice chicken lengthwise into 1-inch (2 cm) thick slices.
Take each slice of chicken and cut it in half lengthwise leaving about 1 inch (2 cm) uncut on one end of the strip.
Cut off part of the uncut end of the chicken so you do not have a thick spot in the middle of your longer chicken strip.
Place chicken strips in a bowl.
Add ½ teaspoon salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice and mix to combine.
Transfer to the refrigerator.
On a cutting board, slice each piece of bacon lengthwise creating 12 strips in total.
Wrap the cut strip of bacon around the asparagus.
Wrap a marinated chicken strip around the bacon-wrapped asparagus.
Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Place each bacon chicken asparagus twist on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Turn up the heat to broil, and broil for 10 minutes.
Flip the twists over, and broil for an additional ten minutes.
In a bowl add the Greek yogurt parsley, dill, ½ teaspoon salt, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice.
Stir until well combined.
Remove bacon asparagus twists from baking sheet, and let cool.
Serve with herb yogurt dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
