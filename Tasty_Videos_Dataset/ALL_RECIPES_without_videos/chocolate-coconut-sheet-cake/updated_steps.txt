Preheat oven to 350℉ (175˚C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with nonstick spray.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder.
Whisk to combine.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar with an electric hand mixer until fluffy.
Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating to incorporate each addition before adding the next.
Add the vanilla and beat to combine.
Add ½ of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat on low speed to incorporate.
Add ½ of the coconut milk and beat again.
Add the remaining flour, then the remaining coconut milk, and beat until fully incorporated.
Pour the cake batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer.
Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the center is set and edges begin to pull away from the pan.
Let cool completely.
Once the cake is cooled, scoop the chocolate frosting on top and spread in an even layer.
Sprinkle the shredded coconut on top.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
