In a saucepan over medium high heat add carrots and water.
Let steam for 5 minutes, or until slightly tender.
Drain the carrots and let cool in a medium mixing bowl.
Once cool add Parmesan cheese, egg, flour, corn, parsley, and salt to a bowl and mix until the mixture has a semi-creamy texture.
Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and add vegetable oil.
Use a spoon to scoop out medium dollops of the carrot mixture and place it in the pan.
Let cook on each side for about 3 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove from pan and place on paper towel to absorb excess oil.
Enjoy!
