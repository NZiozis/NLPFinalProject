Whisk eggs, cinnamon, vanilla and milk together in medium-large bowl to create egg wash.
Crush graham crackers into crumbs.
Dunk bread in egg wash then cover in crumbs until evenly coated.
Melt butter in a skillet on medium-low heat and cook bread for 2-3 minutes or until crumbs are crispy and bread is more solid.
Once you flip them over once spread fluff on one slice and melted chocolate on the other.
Press slices together and stack.
Garnish with mini marshmallows, mini chocolate chips (optional) and chocolate syrup.
Enjoy!
