In a large bowl, combine the chicken thighs with the salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried thyme, dried parsley, and olive oil.
Toss until well coated.
In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the chicken and cook until itâ€™s golden brown on one side, then flip, and cook the other side, about10 minutes total.
Remove the chicken and set aside.
To the pan, add the butter, carrots, onions, celery, mushrooms, and garlic.
Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook until the veggies are soft.
Scoop out and set aside.
Add the wild rice and the chicken broth to the pot.
Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook the rice for 45 minutes, or until tender.
Once the rice is cooked, stir in the Parmesan, vegetables, heavy cream, and fresh thyme.
Bring to a boil.
Stir in the sour cream.
Add the chicken back to the pan.
Serve the chicken over the rice and garnish with grated Parmesan and fresh parsley.
Enjoy!
