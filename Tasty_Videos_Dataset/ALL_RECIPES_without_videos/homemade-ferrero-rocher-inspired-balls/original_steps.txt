Blend up the malted milk biscuits and put them into a big mixing bowl. Fold in the Rice Krispies and the Nutella.
Take a big pinch of the mixture and roll into balls using your hands. Place the shaped mixture on to some baking paper and chill for 1 hour.
Break up the chocolate and add to a bowl with the butter. Microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring until the mixture is smooth.
Dip the Nutella balls into the chocolate coating them generously and place back on to the baking paper.
Chill for a further 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Enjoy!
