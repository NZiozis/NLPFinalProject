Skewer 3-4 pieces of chicken and green onions in an alternating pattern on a bamboo skewer. Repeat with remaining chicken & onions.
Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
Sear 3-4 skewers at a time and flip when the undersides are golden brown.
In a medium pot, combine all ingredients for glaze and bring to a boil until the bubbles start to become sticky and glossy.
Brush the glaze on the skewers evenly and cook for about 4 more minutes, flipping every minute and glazing occasionally.
Cool, then serve with additional green onions on top!
Enjoy!
