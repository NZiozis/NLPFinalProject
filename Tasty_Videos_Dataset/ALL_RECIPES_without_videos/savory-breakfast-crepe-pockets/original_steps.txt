Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a bowl, mix the flour, eggs, ½ cup (120 ml) of milk, and salt, until smooth.
Add in the remaining milk and mix again until the batter is thin and smooth.
Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat.
Add the butter and onions to the pan. Cook until browned.
Add garlic, spinach, and salt, and stir until spinach is wilted.
Remove the spinach mixture and clean the pan.
Return the pan to medium heat and add ¼-½ cup of the batter into the pan.
Swirl the batter to coat the pan and leave on the heat until the sides start to lift up from the pan.
Using a spatula flip the crepe over and cook through, about 2 minutes.
Repeat with remaining batter.
Lay the crepes on a baking sheet.
Place one slice of cheese in the middle of a crepe.
Top the cheese with 2 slices of ham and the spinach mixture.
Top with a fried egg and fold the edges over the egg, pressing down to make sure the sides stay in place. Repeat with other crepe.
Bake the crepes for 5 minutes or until yolk is at the desired consistency.
Enjoy!
