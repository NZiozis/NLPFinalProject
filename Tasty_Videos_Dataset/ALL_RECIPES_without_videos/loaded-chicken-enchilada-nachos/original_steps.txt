Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Heat a small saucepan over medium heat and add the oil and flour. Whisk together and cook gently until it resembles wet sand, about 1 minute.
Add the tomato paste and whisk. Add chicken stock, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Stir.
Bring up to a simmer and cook about 5 minutes until sauce thickens. Remove from heat and set aside. Reserve ½ cup (120 ml).
Toss the shredded chicken with about ½ cup (120 ml) of the reserved sauce.
Place a layer of tortilla chips in a skillet or bake dish. Add a layer of cheese and half the chicken mixture. Drizzle some enchilada sauce over the top.
Add a second layer of tortilla chips followed by another layer of cheese and the remaining chicken. Drizzle with sauce.
Bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese is melted.
Top with sour cream, diced tomato, cilantro, and crumbled queso fresco. Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
