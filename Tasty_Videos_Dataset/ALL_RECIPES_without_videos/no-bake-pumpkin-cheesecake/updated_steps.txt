In a bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter.
Transfer the graham cracker mixture to a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan, creating an even base that goes up 1-inch (2 cm) on the sides.
In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and heavy cream and beat until smooth, 3-4 minutes.
Add the sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon and vanilla and beat until smooth and fluffy.
Pour the cream cheese mixture into the springform pan, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 6-8 hours.
Top with whipped cream, slice, and serve!
Enjoy!
