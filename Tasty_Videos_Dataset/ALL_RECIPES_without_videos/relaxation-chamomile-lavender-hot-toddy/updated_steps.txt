Combine the water, tea bag, and lavender buds in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 3-4 minutes, until the liquid is slightly reduced and the lavender is fragrant.
Strain to remove lavender buds.
In a mug, stir to combine the strained tea, honey, and whiskey.
Finish with a squeeze of lemon and garnish with a lemon slice and a few lavender buds.
Enjoy!
