In a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, crush the pomegranate and cumin seeds, then transfer to a medium bowl.
Add the chickpea flour, black pepper, cayenne, coriander, baking powder, and salt, and stir to combine.
Mix in the yogurt, water, and cilantro, and stir until evenly incorporated.
A few lumps are okay.
Rest for 15 minutes to let the flour hydrate.
Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C).
Mix the onions and sliced jalapeños into the batter.
Dip the slices of potato, eggplant, and the whole jalapenos into the batter.
Try to get the onions and other bits in the batter stuck to the dipped veggies to create more texture.
Fry the dipped vegetables, making sure not to overcrowd the pot, until deep golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.
Drain on a wire rack or paper towels, then salt the pakoras while they are still hot.
Dip in mint chutney, tamarind sauce, and/or ketchup.
Enjoy!
