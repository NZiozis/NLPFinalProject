In a baking pan, lay down one row of raw ramen noodles and cover with half the tomato sauce mixture.
Layer ham slices, then cheese slices, and repeat. Sprinkle with parsley.
Add another layer of raw ramen noodles and cover them with the rest of sauce.
Top with another layer of ham and cheese, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese and oregano.
