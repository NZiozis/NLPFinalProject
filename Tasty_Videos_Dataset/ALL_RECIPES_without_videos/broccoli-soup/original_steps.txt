On a cutting board, use a knife to remove the broccoli florets. Discard the stem.
In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a rolling boil, season with salt, and add broccoli. Cover and cook for 3Â½-4 minutes, until a knife can easily run through the florets.
Transfer the broccoli to a blender with a slotted spoon. Reserve the water.
Add broccoli, pepper, and broccoli stock to the blender and blend until smooth. Keep adding water until desired consistency is reached.
Enjoy!
