In a large bowl, crumble the cake into fine uniform crumbs. Add the vanilla frosting and mix thoroughly.
Press 1 tablespoon of the cake mixture into each of the divots of an ice cube tray.
Spread 1 tablespoon of vanilla ice cream over the cake. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of crushed cookies.
Spread 1 tablespoon of chocolate ice cream on top (the ice cream might melt and mix slightly).
Freeze for 30 minutes.
Dip the ice pop sticks into 2 tablespoons of melted white chocolate and press them into the centers of the ice cream cake pops. Freeze for at least 8 hours, until solid.
To make the cake pop holder, cut 3 2-foot by 5-inch (½ meter by 13 cm) strips of foam board. Place tape in between each layer, one on top of the other, so you have 3 layers of foam board. Carefully create 24 ½-inch (1 cm) slits 2 inches (2 cm) apart with a precision knife. Cut deep enough so you puncture the second layer of foam board. Each cake pop should easily push into the board and stand upright.
Use a butter knife or offset spatula to loosen the ice cream cake pops from the ice cube tray.
Add the remaining melted white chocolate to a tall drinking glass. Working 1 at a time, pull each cake pop from the ice cube mold and dip into the melted white chocolate. Place the cake pops in the cake pop holder or on a plate and keep in the freezer until ready to serve.
Decorate the cake pops with whipped cream and sprinkles, if desired.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
