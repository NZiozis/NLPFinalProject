Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl.
In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt.
Add the dry ingredients to the creamed butter and sugar. Make sure it’s well incorporate, it will have a crumbly texture.
Add the milk and vanilla. Bring together and refrigerate for 30 min.
Melt the caramel with salt, heavy cream and vanilla in the microwave (2 min).
Add the melted caramel to the the toasted coconut. Make sure to save about ¼ cup of the melted caramel. The reserved caramel will be used to ‘glue’ the caramel coconut mix to the cookie.
Roll out cookie dough and cut out your cookies. Place on a parchment paper and bake for 10-13 minutes at 350°F (175°C). Set aside to cool down.
Once the cookie is cool enough to touch, add some of the reserved caramel to the top, then add a layer of caramel coconut.
Dip in melted chocolate and drizzle chocolate over the top. Let chocolate set.
Enjoy!
