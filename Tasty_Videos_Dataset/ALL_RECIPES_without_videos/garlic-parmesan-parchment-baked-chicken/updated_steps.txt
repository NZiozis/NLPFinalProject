Fold the parchment paper in half, then open up.
Slice the zucchini into rounds and lay them on one half of the parchment paper.
Mix the minced garlic and butter in a small bowl and spoon half of the garlic butter on top of the zucchini.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Lay the chicken on the zucchini, season with salt and pepper and spoon on the rest of the garlic butter.
Top with parmesan.
Fold the parchment paper over the chicken, and cinch the paper together by folding it over itself along the edges.
Bake for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 165˚F (75˚C).
