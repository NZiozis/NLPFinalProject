Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
Make the flax eggs: combine the flax meal with the water and set aside for 10 minutes to gel.
In a large bowl, combine the milk, maple syrup, flax eggs, applesauce, fruit and vegetable pulp, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla.
Stir for about 30 seconds, until well-combined.
Add the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
Stir for about 30 seconds, until combined.
Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
Then, fill each cup with the batter about ¾ of the way full.
Sprinkle the tops with oats.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
Let cool for at least 15 minutes, then serve.
Enjoy!
