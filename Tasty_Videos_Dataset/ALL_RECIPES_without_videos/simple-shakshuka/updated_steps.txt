Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat.
Once the pan is hot, add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan.
Add the onion, bell pepper, salt, and pepper.
Sauté 5 minutes, or until the onion is almost translucent.
Add the cumin, paprika, and garlic.
Sauté 2-3 minutes, or until the garlic is slightly brown.
Pour in the crushed tomatoes and add the bay leaf.
Simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture has thickened.
Stir in the baby kale until wilted.
Reduce the heat to low, then carefully crack the eggs into the sauce.
Cover and simmer until the egg whites are set, about 10-12 minutes.
Top with the feta cheese and remove the pan from the heat.
Enjoy!
