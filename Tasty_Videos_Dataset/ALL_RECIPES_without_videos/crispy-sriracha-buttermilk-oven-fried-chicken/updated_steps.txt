On a cutting board, slice each chicken breast into strips.
In a bowl, combine the buttermilk and Sriracha and mix to combine.
Add the chicken strips and submerge in the buttermilk mixture.
Cover with plastic wrap.
Or toss all of the ingredients into a resealable bag.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
In a shallow dish, add the Panko, flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and seasoning salt and mix to combine.
Dip the chicken strips in the panko mixture, ensuring they are fully coated.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with canola oil.
Transfer the chicken to the baking sheet, and bake for 10 minutes.
Flip the chicken over, and bake for an additional 10 minutes.
If desired, broil for 2-3 minutes to crisp up at the end.
Transfer the chicken to a paper towel-lined plate to remove extra grease.
Enjoy!
