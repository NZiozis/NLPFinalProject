Peel the ginger using a spoon, then slice thinly.
Cube the chicken breasts.
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the garlic and fry until golden brown, 2-3 minutes.
Remove from the pan, draining off any excess oil, and set aside.
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan with a lid over medium-high heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and sliced ginger and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes.
Add the chicken and rice and stir to combine.
Season with salt and pepper.
Add the water and cover with the lid.
Simmer until the water is absorbed, the rice is tender, and the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the fish sauce.
Serve the chicken and rice with lime juice, hard-boiled eggs, scallions, the fried garlic, and chicharrones.
Enjoy!
