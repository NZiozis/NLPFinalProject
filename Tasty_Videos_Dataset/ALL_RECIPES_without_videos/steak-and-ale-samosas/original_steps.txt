Cut steak into 8 mm (¼ inch) cubes.
Toss with flour to coat evenly.
In a large stock pot or dutch oven, sear steak pieces in batches.
Remove all steak and sauté 1 large carrot and 1 medium onion, diced, until translucent. Add steak back to the pot with carrots and onions.
Pour over 240 ml (½ pint) of ale and 100 ml (½ cup) of stock.
Add 2 sprigs of thyme. Simmer for 1-2 hours, the longer the better.
For the Samosa dough, combine flour, 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 2 tsp minced rosemary, and 1 tsp salt.
Add water, a splash at a time, working the flour into a dough. You’ll end up using approximately 40 ml (3 tbsp). Let dough rest 30 minutes before using.
For Minted Mushy Peas, in a food processor, whizz up frozen peas, greek yogurt, a bunch of mint, a squirt of lemon, and a pinch of salt.
To form the Samosa, split the dough in half and then in half again. Take one of these quarters and roll it into a flat circle, about 2 mm (⅛ inch) thick. Cut this dough in half with a knife.
Pick up 1 semi-circle, and wipe the flat edge with a wet finger. Fold this flat edge together to form a cone, pinch together the overlapping dough. Holding in one hand like a cone, fill 80% full with cooled samosa filling. Wipe the rim of the cone with a wet finger and pull together, pinching to seal.
Shallow fry in approximately 3 cm (1 inch) of vegetable oil.
Serve with Minted Mushy Peas.
Enjoy!
