Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Prepare the cake batter according to the package instructions.
Line a 12-cup muffin tin with the orange liners.
Scoop ¼ cup (30 G) of cake batter into each cup. Bake according to the package instructions, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Let cool for 30 minutes.
Frost each cupcake with a flat layer of chocolate frosting.
Divide the buttercream frosting between small bowls and dye with gel food coloring as desired. Transfer the colored buttercream to piping bags fitted with your desired tips.
Pipe succulent shapes onto the cupcakes.
Enjoy!
