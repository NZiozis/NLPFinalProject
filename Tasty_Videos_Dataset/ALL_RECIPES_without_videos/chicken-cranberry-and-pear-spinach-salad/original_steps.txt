Add the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, honey, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Set aside.
On a cutting board, season the chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes.
In a large bowl, add the sliced pear, spinach, cranberries, walnuts, and cooked chicken, and dress with the vinaigrette.
Enjoy!
