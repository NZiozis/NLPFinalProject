In a bowl mix together yogurt and 1 cup flour (125 g) until it forms a smooth dough.
Transfer dough to a floured surface.
Divide into four equal parts.
Roll out each section of dough to about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter using plenty of flour to prevent sticking or tearing.
Cook the bread in a dry hot pan set over medium high heat.
Cook each side for 2-4 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.
Enjoy!
