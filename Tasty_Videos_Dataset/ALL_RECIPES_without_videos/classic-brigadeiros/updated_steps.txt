In a pot over low heat, melt the butter, condensed milk, and cocoa powder, stirring continuously until you can see the bottom of the pot for 2-3 seconds when dragging a spatula through.
Pour onto a greased plate, then chill for 1 hour.
Shape and roll the chilled mixture into balls.
Roll the balls in chocolate sprinkles.
Serve and enjoy!
