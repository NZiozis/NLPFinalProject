Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C.)
Grate the zucchini into a bowl and salt generously.
Allow zucchini to sit for 20 minutes as the salt draws out moisture.
Pour zucchini onto a clean dish towel and wring it out over the sink or into a separate bowl.
Pour the zucchini back into your bowl and add bread crumbs, cheddar cheese, eggs, garlic powder, and pepper.
Mix together until well-blended.
Take a tablespoon of mixture and roll it into a tot, repeat for rest of mixture.
Place on a greased baking sheet and place in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until tots are crunchy.
Serve warm.
Enjoy!
