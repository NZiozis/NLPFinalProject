In a large bowl, mix the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit for 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes cloudy and slightly foamy.
Add the flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil to the bowl with the yeast mixture and stir until combined.
Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3-5 minutes.
Wipe the large bowl clean and lightly coat with remaining oil. Place the dough into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel.
Set in a warm place for 20 minutes, or until the dough has nearly doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 450ºF (230ºC), and line a sheet tray with parchment paper.
Once risen, turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and stretch the dough into a 12x22-inch (30x56 cm) rectangle.
Layer the cheddar, broccoli, and chicken in the center of the rectangle, lengthwise, leaving 1-2 inches (2 ½-5 cm) on the top and bottom.
Slice the dough in half through the center, lengthwise.
Fold each piece’s center edge towards the outer edge and pat down, creating a long roll-up.
Slice each roll into 4-5 equal pieces. Pinch the edges closed on all the pieces and place on sheet tray.
Brush the tops with olive oil and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until light golden brown.
Serve immediately or allow to cool, then freeze in an airtight container up to 1-2 months.
To reheat, microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute.
Enjoy!
