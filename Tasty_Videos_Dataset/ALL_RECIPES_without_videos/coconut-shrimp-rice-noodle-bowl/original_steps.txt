In a small bowl, stir together the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.
Place the shrimp on a cutting board and pat dry with paper towels. Season the shrimp on both sides with the spice mixture.
Add the flour, eggs, and panko to 3 separate shallow bowls. Add the coconut flakes to the bread crumbs and stir to combine.
Dredge the shrimp in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the floured shrimp in the beaten egg, then into the panko mixture. Transfer the breaded shrimp to a baking sheet until ready to fry.
Heat 3 inches (7 ½ cm) of canola oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 350˚F (180˚C).
Working in batches, fry the shrimp in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, 2-3 minutes, turning halfway through. Transfer the shrimp to a wire rack to drain.
In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, lime zest, sesame oil, brown sugar, and Sriracha. Using tongs, toss the rice noodles in the sauce until fully coated.
Divide the noodles between 4 bowls. Top with the carrot ribbons, avocado, coconut shrimp, cucumber, basil, mint, cilantro, and scallions. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds, if using.
Enjoy!
