Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish with parchment paper.
Add the almonds, dates, pretzels, salt, milk, and vanilla to a food processor and pulse until the mixture starts to clump together.
Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and press into an even layer.
Drizzle the top with Greek yogurt, if desired.
Chill for 1 hour.
Remove the bars from the baking dish by lifting the parchment paper. Cut into 12 individual bars.
Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
Enjoy!
