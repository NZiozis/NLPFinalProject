In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook until semi-translucent, 3-4 minutes.
Use your hands to crumble the tofu into the pan, then use a spatula to continue to break apart while cooking for 3-4 minutes, until slightly browned.
Add the soy sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, paprika, and cayenne.
Continue to cook and break the tofu apart until browned and crumbly.
To assemble, spread brown rice on the bottom of a bowl, then layer on lettuce, black beans, corn, tofu sofritas, pico de gallo, guacamole, and onions.
Serve topped with cilantro.
Enjoy!
