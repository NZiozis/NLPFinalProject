Cover and microwave for 3 minutes.
Let it sit for 1 minute, wrapped.
Sprinkle your tabletop with enough potato starch to avoid sticking.

Using a rolling pin, stretch mochi out very thin (about Â½ cm to 1 cm thickness).
Set aside until it gets to room temperature.
In a large bowl, combine heavy cream, syrup, and chocolate powder.
Whip until small peaks form.
Add the diced chestnuts and fold them into the cream.
Slice the mochi sheet into 12 even pieces.
Or depending on the cookie used for the base, make sure to have 2 cm to fold under.
Place a spoonful of cream on the cookie.
Place one sheet of mochi over the cream and fold under the cookie.
Garnish with more cocoa powder.
Enjoy!
