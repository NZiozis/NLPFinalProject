Season the meat on all sides with salt and pepper.
Heat a large heavy pot with a lid over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and brown the meat in batches until a crust forms, turning to ensure even color on all sides.
Once one batch is done, set aside in a bowl or plate with a lip, add another fresh tablespoon of olive oil and continue until all the meat is brown.
Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and sauté the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
Pour in the wine and let it boil off and reduce until barely any remains in the pan.
Next, add the browned meat back to the pan, along with the tomato paste. Stir until tomato paste is coating all the ingredients and allow the paste to toast slightly.
Pour in the tomatoes, stock, and herb bundle and stir, bring to a simmer and cover with a lid.
Allow to simmer for 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Alternatively, if your pot and lid are oven safe, cook in a 325˚F (170˚C) oven for 3 hours.
Remove the herb bundle and beef shank.
Pull the meat from the oxtail. Using a fork or tongs, discarding the bone and any extra cartilage or extra fat. Add the meat back to the ragu and stir.
Skim off any extra fat from the top of the ragu.
Cook pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup (120 ml) of the pasta water before draining.
Add a few ladlefuls of ragu, the pasta, and a splash of pasta water to a large pot, gently stir to coat the pasta in the ragu.
Add a handful of cheese and stir to melt into the sauce.
Garnish with more cheese and fresh parsley before serving.
Enjoy!
