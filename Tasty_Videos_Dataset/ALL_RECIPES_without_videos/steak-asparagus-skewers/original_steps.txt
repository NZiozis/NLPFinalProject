Skewer 3-4 pieces of steak and asparagus in an alternating pattern on a bamboo skewer.
Repeat with remaining steak and asparagus.
Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
Sear 3-4 skewers at a time, seasoning with salt and pepper, and flip when the undersides are a dark brown.
Season the other side with salt and pepper, and cook for about 1 more minute.
Cool and serve!
Enjoy!
