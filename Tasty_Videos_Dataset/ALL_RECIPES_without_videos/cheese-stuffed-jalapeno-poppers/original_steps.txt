Cut the top off each jalapeño and core it, scraping out all the seeds, with the back side of a spoon.
Fill the jalapeños with pepper jack cheese, either melted or cubed.
Place the top back on the jalapeños and secure with two toothpicks inserted diagonally.
NOTE: Be sure each toothpick goes through both the top and the bottom of the jalapeño to secure it.
Dredge in flour, eggs, then breadcrumbs. For a thicker breading, double bread the jalapeños by repeating the egg and breadcrumb dredging.
Heat oil to 325°F (160°C).
Fry each jalapeño popper until golden brown (about 2-3 minutes).
Cool and allow extra oil to drip off on a plate lined with paper towels. Remove the toothpicks.
Season with salt and serve immediately once cooled enough to handle.
Enjoy!
