Combine cherries, sugar, cornstarch, almond extract, and lemon juice in a saucepan.
Cook over low heat for 5-10 minutes, crushing the cherries with a spoon and stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat and let cool.
Preheat oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Roll out the puff pastry.
Using a cookie cutter, cut 9 rounds out of each sheet of pastry.
Fill each round with a spoonful of cherry filling.
Fold in half over the filling and pinch closed with your fingers, followed by a fork.
Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with raw sugar.
Bake 10-12 minutes until golden brown and puffy.
Cool slightly and serve with a cup of coffee.
Enjoy!
