Add ham, salt, onion and bbq sauce to a slow cooker.
Cover and cook on low for 5 hours.
Shred ham using two forks.
Preheat oven to 375°F (180°C).
Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 16x12-inch (40x30-cm) rectangle, about ¼-inch (6 mm) thick on a well-floured surface.
Distribute shredded ham over the dough, leaving a 1-inch (2 cm) open strip on the short side facing you.
Roll the dough into a log shape, pinching the seams to seal it.
With a serrated knife, evenly cut roll into 8 slices.
Arrange slices in a greased cake pan.
Bake in oven for 20-25 minutes.
Cool in pan for 10-15 minutes.
Drizzle rolls with more BBQ sauce and top with relish, if desired.
Enjoy!
