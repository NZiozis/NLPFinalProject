In a bowl, combine chicken, celery, onion, sliced tomatoes, apple, yogurt, salt and pepper.
Spread the chicken salad on one of the pieces of bread and place the lettuce on the other piece. Top with desired condiments and bring the two pieces of bread together. Cut in half and place in a reusable container with some fruits and veggies.
Enjoy!
