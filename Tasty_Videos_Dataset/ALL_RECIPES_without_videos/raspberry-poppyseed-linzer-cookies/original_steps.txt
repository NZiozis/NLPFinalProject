Make the raspberry jam: In a medium pot over medium heat, combine the raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Remove from the heat and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before assembling the cookies.
Make the cookies: In a medium bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour and almond flour. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, salt, lemon zest, and vanilla with an electric hand mixer until fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Add the poppy seeds and beat for 1 minute to distribute evenly.
Add the egg and beat for 1–2 minutes, until well incorporated.
Pour in the flour mixture and fold with a spatula, just until no streaks of flour remain. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until firm.
Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Unwrap the dough on a floured surface and dust the top of the dough with more flour. Roll out the dough to ¼-inch (½ cm) thickness.
Using a 2½-inch (6 ⅓ cm) round cookie cutter with ridged edges, cut out cookies, chilling and re-rolling the dough as needed to cut out more cookies. You should have about 38 total.
Use a ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) cutter to cut out the centers of half of the cookies. Transfer cookies to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake the cookies for 12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Let cool completely.
To assemble, spread 1 teaspoon of jam onto the whole cookies. Top with the cut-out cookies.
Enjoy!
