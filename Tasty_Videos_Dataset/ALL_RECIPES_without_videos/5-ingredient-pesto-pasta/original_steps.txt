Separate the head of broccoli into individual florets, coat in olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roast for 20 minutes at 180°C (350°F).
Cook the rigatoni in boiling salted water for 8-10 minutes until al dente, then drain, saving some of the pasta water.
Place the pasta back in the pot with about 50ml (¼ cup) of the pasta water.
On a low heat, add the tomatoes, broccoli, pesto, and parmesan, and stir until combined and the cheese has melted.
Enjoy!
