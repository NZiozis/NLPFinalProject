Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper and cook until the mushrooms are softened. Remove from the pot.
Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the flour to the pot. Whisk until the flour is toasted, approximately 2 minutes.
Add the milk while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce is thickened.
Whisk in the Parmesan and cheddar cheeses and season with salt and pepper.
Add the cooked pasta and mushrooms. Mix until the sauce coats the pasta well.
Top with truffle oil and chives.
Enjoy!
