In a large bowl, prepare the brownie mix.
Spray 2 ramekins with the cooking spray.
Place a spoonful of the brownie batter into each ramekin, then place two chocolate truffles in each dish.
Spoon more brownie batter over the top of the truffles, until the ramekin is about Â¾-full. Smooth the batter evenly over the truffles.
Bake for 25 minutes, then cool for another 25 minutes.
On the serving plate, place the berries and the mint in a corner.
To ensure that the brownie comes loose, run a knife around the edges of each ramekin before inverting the dish onto the center of each plate.
Serve with ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.
Enjoy!
