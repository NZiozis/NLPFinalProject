Bring pizza dough to room temperature.
Cut the dough into strips and stretch/roll out.
Roll up mini hotdogs in pizza dough so the dough wraps around twice - leaving the ends sticking out and cutting off any excess.
Place on a lightly greased baking sheet until ready to boil.
Bring water to a light boil. Add in Baking Soda.
Once dissolved, boil wrapped hot dogs in water mixture for 20-30 seconds each (working in small batches).
Remove and place back on baking tray. Brush each lightly with beaten egg and sprinkle with sea salt.
Bake in a preheated oven at 425˚F (220˚C) for 15-20 minutes until the dough is nicely browned.
Enjoy!
