In a large bowl add your blueberries, brown sugar, cinnamon and cornstarch.
Mix it together throughly.
Quarter your pre-made biscuits and set aside.
In a slow cooker pour your blueberry mix and top evenly with your quartered biscuits.
Cook on high for two and half to three hours.
Server a la mode with vanilla ice cream or your favorite whipped cream.
Enjoy!
