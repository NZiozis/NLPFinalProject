Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add the bell pepper, black beans, corn, and onions, and cook until caramelized, about 5 minutes.
Remove the vegetables from the pan and set aside.
Reduce heat to low, and eggs, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Cook, stirring constantly, until barely set, about 2 minutes.
Place the vegetables, scrambled eggs, and cheese in the center of a tortilla, and fold the sides into the center, completely covering the filling.
Add the quesadilla, seam side down, to the skillet and cook over medium heat until the outside is toasted and cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
