Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Add the oil to a large pot over high heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken, and stir until cooked through, about 7 minutes.
Transfer the chicken to a bowl.
Melt butter in the same pot.
Add the onions and carrots and stir until softened, about 8 minutes.
Add the flour, stirring to combine.
Slowly add the milk and chicken broth, alternating between the two, stirring continuously and bringing to a boil.
Add the cooked chicken, peas, salt, and pepper, and stir until thoroughly mixed.
Remove from heat and let cool.
Lay out puff pastry sheets and use a small 6-inch (15 cm) bowl to cut circles out of it.
Place dough circles in a nonstick muffin tin and fill with pot pie mixture.
Using remaining puff pastry, cut ⅛-inch (3 mm) strips of dough, and make a lattice top for each muffin cup.
Brush the lattice tops with the egg.
Bake for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
Enjoy!
