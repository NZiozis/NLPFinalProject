In a medium pot over medium-high heat, whisk together the water and cranberry sauce until combined. Bring to a boil, then transfer to a large bowl.
Add the gelatin and whisk to dissolve. Add the vodka and whisk to combine.
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solids.
Divide the mixture between small cups. Cover with plastic wrap, then let set in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
Garnish with orange twists.
Enjoy!
