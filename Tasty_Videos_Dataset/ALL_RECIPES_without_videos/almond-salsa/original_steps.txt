Char the bell pepper over a burner or under a broiler until it is well-blackened on all sides. Wrap in a plastic bag and set aside until cool enough to handle, then peel and seed the pepper. Set aside.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the chiles de árbol and habanero and toast until fragrant, about 3 minutes; toward the end of toasting, add the pine nuts and almonds and toast until fragrant.
Add the tomatillos, tomatoes, water and three-fourths teaspoon salt, and cook over high heat until the tomatillos are tender, about 10 minutes.
Transfer mixture to a blender along with the bell pepper and purée until smooth. Add the red wine vinegar and adjust seasoning. The salsa should be thick enough to generously coat the back of a spoon. Any unused salsa will keep, covered tightly, in the refrigerator for a week.
Enjoy!
