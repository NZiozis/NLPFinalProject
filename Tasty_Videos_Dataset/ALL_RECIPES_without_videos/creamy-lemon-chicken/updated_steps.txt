On a cutting board, cut the chicken breasts in half, widthwise.
Lay chicken flat and season both sides with salt and pepper.
Gently coat the chicken pieces in the flour, shaking off any excess.
Heat a skillet on medium-high heat and add the butter and oil, swirling together to coat the pan.
Place the chicken breasts into the pan and cook for 3-5 minutes or until golden brown.
Flip the chicken and cook the other side, another 3-5 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
Pour Â¼ cup (60 ml) of the chicken stock in the pan and scrape up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.
Add the rest of the stock and the cream and stir.
Season with salt and pepper, and add the lemon juice.
Simmer for 5 minutes.
Add the chicken back to the pan and top with sliced lemons.
Spoon the sauce over the chicken.
Remove from heat.
Sauce will thicken as it cools.
Serve with parsley and extra sauce.
Enjoy!
