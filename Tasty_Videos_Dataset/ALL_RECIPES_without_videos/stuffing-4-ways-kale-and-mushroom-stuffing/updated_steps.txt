Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking dish.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the celery, onions, and garlic.
Cook until softened and golden, about 5 minutes.
Add the mushrooms and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add the kale, sage, and rosemary.
Cook for another 5 minutes, until the kale is wilted.
In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, vegetable stock, half of the parsley, the salt, and pepper.
In a large bowl, combine the bread and cooked vegetable mixture.
Pour the egg mixture over the bread and vegetable mixture, and stir to coat.
Transfer the stuffing to the prepared baking dish and cover with foil.
Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
Top with the remaining parsley.
Enjoy!
