Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
Place crackers on a greased, parchment paper-lined baking sheet so that the entire surface is covered.
In a saucepan, melt butter on low heat.
Once melted, add brown sugar and turn heat to medium.
Continue stirring until boiling, then boil for 3 minutes.
Pour the caramel over the crackers, spreading evenly with a spatula.
Bake for 5 minutes.
Pour the chocolate chips over the crackers and cover with tin foil for 3 minutes.
Remove the foil and spread the softened chocolate over the top evenly.
Sprinkle with pecans, cover with foil, and freeze for 1 hour.
Break the bark up into pieces.
Enjoy!
