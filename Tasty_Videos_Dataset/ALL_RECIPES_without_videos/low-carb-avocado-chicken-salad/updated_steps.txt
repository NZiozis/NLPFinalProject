In a blender or food processor, combine the yogurt, lime juice, pepper, and chili powder and pulse to combine.
Add ½ of the avocado and blend until creamy.
In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt sauce, celery, the remaining ½ avocado, onion, and salt.
Mix until well combined.
Serve on low-carb bread and garnish with cilantro, or as desired.
Enjoy!
