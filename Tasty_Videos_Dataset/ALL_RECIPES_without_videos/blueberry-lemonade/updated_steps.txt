Place blueberries, lemon juice, and cold water in a blender and blend until smooth.
Strain the blueberries mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, using a spoon to press the last of the liquid through.
Add the sparkling water and honey and mix until the honey dissolves.
Serve over ice with extra blueberries.
Enjoy!
