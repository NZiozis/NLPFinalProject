In a medium bowl, soak the lentils in cold water for 3 hours.
Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a food processor, combine the soaked lentils, carrot, corn, peas, vegan cheese, oregano, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and garlic, and pulse until well mixed.
Take about 1 tablespoon worth of mixture and form it into a nugget with your hands.
Bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown.
Or, pan fry with a small drizzle of oil over medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Allow to cool 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
