Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Lay out the sweet potato, chicken breasts, and broccoli.
Evenly distribute the garlic, rosemary, paprika, salt, and pepper over the entire pan.
Drizzle with olive oil.
Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 35-40 minutes (or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C) and the juices run clear).
Serve up and dinner’s ready!
For an easy cleanup, just carefully toss the aluminum foil and you’re good to go.
Enjoy!
