Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) baking dish.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Add the celery, onions, and garlic. Cook until softened and golden, about 5 minutes.
Add the oregano and sage. Cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, chicken stock, half of the parsley, the salt, and pepper.
In a large bowl, combine the bread and cooked sausage mixture.
Pour the egg mixture over the bread and sausage mixture, and stir to coat.
Transfer the stuffing to the prepared baking dish and cover with foil.
Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
Top with the remaining parsley.
Enjoy!
