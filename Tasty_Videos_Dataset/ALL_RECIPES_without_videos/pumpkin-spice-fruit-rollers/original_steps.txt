Preheat the oven to 170°F (80°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In the food processor, combine the pumpkin puree, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and dark brown sugar. Process until smooth.
Spread the puree on the prepared baking sheet into an 8x11-inch (20x28-cm) rectangle about ¹⁄₁₆ inch (1 mm) thick.
Bake for 6 hours, or until no longer sticky to the touch. Let cool completely.
Roll the fruit sheet in the parchment paper. Trim the ends, then slice crosswise into 6 1-inch (2-cm) pieces.
Enjoy!
