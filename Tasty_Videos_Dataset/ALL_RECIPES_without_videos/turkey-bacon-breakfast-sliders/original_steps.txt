Preheat Griddler, fitted with the griddle plates, to 425°F (220°C) and grease with nonstick spray.
On a cutting board, arrange 4 slices of turkey bacon vertically directly next to each other. Weave the 5 remaining bacon slices horizontally through the vertical pieces.
Wrap the bacon weave onto a rolling pin, taking care to keep it intact. Carefully transfer the bacon to the griddle and carefully unroll in an even layer.
Close the Griddler and cook for 8 minutes, until the bacon is fully cooked and has begun to crisp up. Remove the bacon weave from the Griddler.
Use a bread knife to slice the intact loaf of rolls crosswise so that the bottoms can be separated from the tops. Set aside the top half.
Place the bacon weave on the bottom half of the rolls.
Distribute the scrambled eggs on top of the bacon weave, smoothing them into an even layer.
Place the cheese on top of the eggs, covering as much area as possible.
Place the lettuce on top of the cheese.
Place the tomato slices evenly on top of the lettuce leaves.
Replace the top half of the rolls and slice the individual sliders.
Enjoy!
