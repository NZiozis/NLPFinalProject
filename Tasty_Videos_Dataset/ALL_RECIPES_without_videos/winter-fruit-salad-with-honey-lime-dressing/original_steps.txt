Slice the pomegranate in half crosswise. Hold the pomegranate cut side down over a medium bowl and tap the back with a wooden spoon to release the seeds. Rinse and drain.
Add the apples, pears, clementines, kiwis, and pomegranate seeds to a large bowl.
In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the lime juice and honey and stir until incorporated.
Drizzle the dressing over fruit and gently toss until well coated.
Serve chilled.
Enjoy!
