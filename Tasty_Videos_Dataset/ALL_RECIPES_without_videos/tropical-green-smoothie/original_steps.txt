Add tofu and maple syrup to a mixing bowl and whisk together until smooth and no large lumps are present.
Transfer tofu mixture to ice tray and use a rubber spatula to evenly spread the mixture into each of the cube slots.
Freeze completely.
Place banana, kiwi, mango, spinach, 4 tofu cubes, and milk in a blender, making sure that the cubes sit on top of the fruit.
Blend until smooth.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
