Slice bread into cubes.
In a bowl, add egg, milk, and cocoa powder, and mix.
In a microwave-safe mug, place half of the cubed bread and desired amount of bananas and chocolate chips.
Place the rest of the bread and fix-ins and pour the egg mixture into the mug.
Microwave for 1Â½ minutes or until egg is fully cooked.
Top it off with whipped cream and chocolate syrup.
Enjoy!
