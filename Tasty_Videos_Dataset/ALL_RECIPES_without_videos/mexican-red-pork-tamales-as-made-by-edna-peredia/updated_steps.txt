Place the dry corn husks in a baking dish.
Pour hot water over the husks to cover.
Weigh the husks down so they are completely submerged and let soak for 2 hours, or until pliable.
Add the tomatoes, onion, guajillos, pasillas, garlic, and 4 cups (960 ml) of water to a small pot.
Cover, bring to a boil, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened.
Transfer the vegetables to a blender, Add salt and pepper to taste, the cumin, and about ½ cup (60 ml) of the cooking liquid.
Blend until smooth.
Set aside.
Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the pork and season with salt and pepper.
Fry the pork until well-browned and most of the fat has evaporated.
Drain any excess fat, if necessary.
Add the sauce to the pan with the pork, bring to a boil, cover, and let simmer until tender, about 1 hour.
Remove from the heat and let cool.
In a small bowl, combine the baking soda, baking powder, and 1 tablespoon water.
Stir to dissolve, then set aside.
Add the lard to a large bowl.
With an electric hand mixer, whip the lard until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
Add the masa and baking soda mixture and mix with your hands until smooth, about 5 minutes.
It should be spreadable but still hold its shape.
Drain the soaked corn husks.
Place 1 husk on a clean surface and add 1-2 tablespoons of masa to the center of the husk.
Spread with the back of the spoon to about ¼ inch (¾ cm) from the edges.
Place 1 tablespoon of meat in the center.
Roll the corn husk over the filling from left to right and fold the top down to create a little pocket.
Set aside.
Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Place the tamales, open ends up, in a steamer basket set over a large pot of boiling water.
Cover with a clean kitchen towel and the lid.
Let steam for 1 hour, then turn off the heat and let the tamales rest for 1 hour more.
Unwrap the tamales and serve with salsa verde.
Enjoy!
