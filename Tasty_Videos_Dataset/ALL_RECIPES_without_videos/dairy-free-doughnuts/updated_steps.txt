Gently melt the butter over a low-medium heat.
Add milk and 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and mix together.
Once combined, take off the heat and set aside.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, half of the sugar, baking powder and salt with a fork.
Make a well in the centre.
Pour the butter mixture into the well.
Combine gradually until a thick dough forms.
Using your hands, roll dough into little flat balls and with your thumb, press a hole in the centre of each doughnut.
(You may need to flour your hands for this part to avoid getting sticky!)
Heat up the litre of oil in a pan.
To know when it's hot enough, fry a little bit of bread in the oil.
If it goes brown and floats to the top, in 45-50 seconds the oil will be ready!
Gently lay the doughnuts into the oil using a spatula.
Fry for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
Transfer the doughnuts onto some tissue paper to soak up any excess oil.
Then roll into a bowl of the remaining sugar.
Enjoy!
