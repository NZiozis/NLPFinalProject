Add the almond milk, egg yolks, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg to a large bowl and whisk to combine.
Pour the mixture into a medium pot and add the cloves, if using.
Warm over low-medium heat for 10-15 minutes, until the temperature reaches 160˚F (70˚C).
Stir constantly and don’t allow the mixture to come to a boil.
Chill or serve warm.
Garnish with cinnamon sticks and more nutmeg.
