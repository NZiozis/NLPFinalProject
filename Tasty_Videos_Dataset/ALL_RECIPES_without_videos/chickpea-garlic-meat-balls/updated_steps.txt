Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a skillet over medium heat, add cooking oil or water and onions.
Cook until onions are translucent, stirring occasionally.
Add the garlic and stir until fragrant.
Transfer to a blender or food processor.
To the food processor, add the chickpeas, breadcrumbs, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and egg.
Pulse until a dough forms.
Use your hands to form 1-inch (2-cm) balls from the chickpea mixture.
Place in rows on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden, flipping halfway.
Enjoy!
