Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Prepare six pint-sized mason jars with nonstick spray or oil of choice to prevent sticking.
In a medium bowl, mash bananas.
Mix eggs, yogurt, honey, vanilla extract, and baking soda into mixture.
Add flour and mix until just combined.
Pour the batter into the mason jars, filling half of each jar.
Do not add the lids.
Bake for 50 mins, or until a toothpick comes out clean from the middle of the bread.
Allow to cool for 15 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
