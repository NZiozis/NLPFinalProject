Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Press the cookie dough in an even layer on the bottom of a 9x9-inch (23x23 cm) square baking pan.
Place the 16 cookies evenly on top of the cookie dough.
Pour the brownie batter on top, spreading it evenly over the cookies.
Bake for 45-50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted inside comes out clean.
Cool, slice, then serve.
Enjoy!
