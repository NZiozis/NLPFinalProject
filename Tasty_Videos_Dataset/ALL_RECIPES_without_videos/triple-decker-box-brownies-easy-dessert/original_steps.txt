Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Press the cookie dough in an even layer on the bottom of a 9-inch (23-cm) square baking dish. Place the cookies in an even layer on top of the cookie dough. Pour the brownie batter on top, spreading it evenly over the cookies.
Bake for 45-50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool, slice, then serve.
Enjoy!
