Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Carefully pierce potatoes with a fork.
On a baking sheet oil the potatoes well and sprinkle with salt.
Bake for one hour.
If making more potatoes, an additional 15 minutes per potato is needed.
Once cooled, cut the potatoes vertically, scoop out the inside, and transfer to a bowl.
In the bowl with the scooped out potato, add the cheese, scallions, ½ cup (110 g) of bacon, sour cream, butter, milk, and pepper, and mix well.
Scoop the potato mixture back into the hollowed-out potatoes and top with cheddar cheese and remaining ¼ cup (55 G) of bacon bits.
Bake an additional 15 minutes until the cheese is melted.
Serve warm with sour cream and chives.
Enjoy!
