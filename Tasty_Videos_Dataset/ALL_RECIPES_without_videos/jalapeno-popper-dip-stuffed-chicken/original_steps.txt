Dice a jalapeño. Then add it in a medium bowl and mix with cream cheese and cheddar cheese.
Salt your chicken breasts. Cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast. Stuff the pockets evenly with the jalapeño mixture. Press the edges of the chicken together to seal the pocket.
Separate the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs into 3 separate bowls.
Dip the stuffed chicken in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs, coating it evenly.
Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Fry the chicken until golden brown on both sides.
Transfer the chicken to a baking dish, then bake for 20 minutes. Serve!
Enjoy!
