Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a medium-sized casserole pan, combine shrimp, salt, pepper, red chili flakes, garlic, butter, lemon juice, and white wine.
Bake for 10-13 minutes, or until shrimp turns pink and is fully cooked.
Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil, add salt to taste, and cook linguine pasta al dente according to package directions, stirring occasionally.
Strain linguine and combine with shrimp until pasta is fully coated in white wine scampi sauce.
Garnish with chopped Italian parsley.
Enjoy!
