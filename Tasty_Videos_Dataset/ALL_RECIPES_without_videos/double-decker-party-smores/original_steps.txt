On a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover the bottom of the tray with half of the graham cracker halves.
Layer a piece of milk chocolate on top of each of the graham cracker, top each piece of chocolate with two marshmallow halves, and top the marshmallows with the remaining graham crackers.
Bake for 5 minutes, or until the marshmallows soften.
Press the top graham crackers to help reset any graham crackers that may have fallen or tilted during baking.
In the first column, layer dark chocolate on top of each graham cracker.
In the second column, layer pieces of the cookies ‘n’ cream bar on top of each graham cracker.
In the third column, layer peanut butter cups on top of each graham cracker.
In the fourth column, layer the mint chocolates on top of each graham cracker.
In the fifth column, layer the pieces of white chocolate on top of each graham cracker.
In the sixth column, layer the chocolate caramels on top of each graham cracker.
