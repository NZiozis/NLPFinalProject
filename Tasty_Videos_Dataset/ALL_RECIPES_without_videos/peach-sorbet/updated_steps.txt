Blend all ingredients in a food processor or high-speed blender until thoroughly combined.
Pour into a rectangular loaf pan and smooth into an even layer.
Freeze for 2 hours, or until frozen but still a little soft for scooping.
(If freezing overnight, cover with a lid or plastic wrap, but let it sit out at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes before scooping.)
Scoop into a bowl.
Enjoy!
