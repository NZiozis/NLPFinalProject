In a small microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate on medium-high heat in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until chocolate is melted. Let cool.
In a medium-size bowl, add the coconut cream, coconut milk, honey, and vanilla. Whisk until incorporated.
Fold in the melted chocolate.
Divide evenly among ramekins. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Garnish to your liking.
Enjoy!
