Cook turkey sausages fully.
Skewer a sausage.
Run a knife around the sausage in a spiral down the full length of the sausage.
Spread the sausage spiral down the skewer and coat in flour, egg wash, and bread crumbs.
Fry in oil until golden brown.
Let cool until safe to touch and remove from skewer.
Enjoy!
