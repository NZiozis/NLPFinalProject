Slice bananas and place in an airtight container. Freeze for at least two hours, preferably overnight.
Place frozen banana slices in a food processor and blend until they reach the consistency of soft serve, about 4 minutes.
Add cocoa powder and cinnamon. Blend until just combined.
Serve immediately for soft-serve consistency or transfer to freezer for at least 2 hours for ice cream consistency.
Garnish with strawberries.
Enjoy!
