Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a large bowl, prepare the cake batter.
Divide the batter evenly among a lined muffin tin, filling halfway.
Finely chop 8 of the strawberries.
Spoon them evenly on top of the batter.
Top with remaining batter, filling about ¾ of the way up.
Bake for 20 minutes, then cool.
In a small bowl, microwave the chocolate chips in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is melted and smooth.
Dip the strawberries in the chocolate, then chill.
Pipe the frosting onto each cupcake, then top with a chocolate-covered strawberry.
Enjoy!
