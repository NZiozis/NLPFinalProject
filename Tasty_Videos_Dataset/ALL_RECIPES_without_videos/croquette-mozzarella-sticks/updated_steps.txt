Add the potatoes to a large pot with enough cold water to cover them.
Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes.
Drain the potatoes and transfer to a large bowl.
Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until there are no large chunks left.
Add the garlic, parsley, Parmesan cheese, 1 beaten egg, salt, and pepper.
Mix well.
Take a spoonful of potatoes and form into a patty.
Place a cheese stick in the middle and wrap the potato around the cheese until it is evenly covered.
Arrange the formed croquettes on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes.
Place the flour, 3 remaining eggs, and bread crumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls.
Dredge the croquettes in the flour, shaking off any excess; then dredge in the egg and the bread crumbs.
Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C).
Fry the croquettes for 3 minutes, or until golden brown.
Transfer the croquettes to a wire rack set over paper towels to drain the excess oil.
Let cool for a few minutes as they will be HOT.
Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and parsley and serve with marinara sauce alongside.
Enjoy!
