Heat a grill to medium-high heat.
Season the salmon with salt and pepper.
Brush the grill grates with oil and place the salmon, skin side down on the oiled grates.
Grill until lightly browned, 3-5 minutes, then gently flip and continue to cook until just opaque in center.
Add the lemon halves to the grill, cut side down and grill until lightly charred, about 2 minutes.
Enjoy!
