Fill half of an ice cube tray with 1 cup (240 ml) of pineapple juice. Fill the other half with 1 cup (240 ml) of coconut milk. Freeze for at least 2 hours.
Add the frozen pineapple juice cubes, frozen coconut milk cubes, mango, remaining pineapple juice, and lemon-lime soda to a blender and blend on high speed until smooth.
Pour into glasses and garnish with maraschino cherries.
Enjoy!
