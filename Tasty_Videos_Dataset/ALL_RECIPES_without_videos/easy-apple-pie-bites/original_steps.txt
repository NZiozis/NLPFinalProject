Stir all of the ‘spice mix’ ingredients together.
Roll the puff pastry out and cut some rough isosceles triangle shapes from it.
Take a thick slice of apple, dip it into the melted butter and place on the end of the pastry.
Scatter a teaspoon of brown sugar over the pastry. Pour some roughly chopped pecans on top of that. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of spice mix over all of that.
Starting at the apple segment, roll the pastry until everything is wrapped into a neat little package.
Bake in the centre of a pre-heated oven for 25-30 minutes - 180°C (350°F) Gas Mark 4.
Allow to cool for 3-5 minutes before eating because the contents are hot!
Enjoy!
