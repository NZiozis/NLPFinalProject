Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Place milk, applesauce, nut butter, maple syrup, vanilla, and eggs in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk until combined.
Add oats, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Stir quickly to make sure everything is well-hydrated.
Pour batter into a greased muffin tin, and add toppings of your choice. Bake for 20–25 minutes or until the middle springs back when gently pressed.
Oatmeal cups can be enjoyed immediately and/or frozen in an airtight container (once completely cool) to be enjoyed later by microwaving for 2 minutes.
Enjoy!
