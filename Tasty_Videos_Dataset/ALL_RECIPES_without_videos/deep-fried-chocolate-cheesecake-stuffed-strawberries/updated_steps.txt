In a bowl, add the cream cheese, vanilla, and ½ cup (80 g) of powdered sugar, and mix thoroughly.
On a cutting board, cut the stem off of the strawberry.
Using a ¼ teaspoon, scoop out the center of the strawberry.
Fill the center of the strawberry with the cream cheese filling.
Repeat with the rest of the strawberries.
In a large bowl, combine the pancake mix, cocoa powder, sugar, salt, milk, and eggs.
Mix thoroughly.
Heat oil in a medium pot over medium heat until the temperature reaches 365˚F (185˚C).
Using a fork, coat the stuffed strawberries in the batter.
Fry 2 strawberries at a time, about two minutes.
Remove the strawberries from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Dust with powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
