Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners.
In a large bowl, cream together the brown sugar and coconut oil with an electric hand mixer until smooth.
Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, pumpkin spice, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, lemon zest, pumpkin puree, and almond milk, and stir with a rubber spatula until well combined.
Use an ice cream scoop to fill each muffin cup about ¾ of the way.
Bake for 20- 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean.
Make the frosting: In a large bowl, cream the vegan butter with an electric hand mixer until smooth. Sift in half the powdered sugar and continue to beat. Sift in the rest of the powdered sugar and beat again.
Fold in the maple syrup and vanilla with a rubber spatula until well combined.
Fold a piece of tape around the one of the bottom corners of a large zip-top bag. Then cut a ¼ inch slit along one edge of the corner.
Put the zip-top bag in a tall glass and scoop a good amount of frosting into the bag. Squeeze all of the frosting toward the taped corner of the bag.
Decorate the cupcakes by frosting small loops resembling petals on top.
Enjoy!
