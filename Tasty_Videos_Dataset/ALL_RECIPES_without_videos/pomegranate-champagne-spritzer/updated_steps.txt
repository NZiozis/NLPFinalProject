Cut the pomegranate in half, and hit it over a bowl with a wooden spoon to release the seeds.
Squeeze half a lemon over the pomegranate seeds.
Pour a half cup of water over the seeds and lemon juice, and spoon the mixture into ice tray of choice.
Freeze the cubes for an hour or until solid.
In a glass, put one cube and then top with champagne.
Watch the drink transform while the ice cube melts.
Enjoy!
