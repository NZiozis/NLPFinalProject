Add vegetables to a large pot or Dutch oven of boiling water. Cover and allow the vegetables to cook for 10 minutes, until the potatoes are fork-tender.
Remove boiled vegetables from water and save 1Â½ - 2 cups (360 ML) of the water.
Add vegetables, cashews, and seasonings to a blender with half of the reserved water. Blend, adding a few tablespoons of water at a time until the desired consistency is achieved.
Pour vegetable puree over the macaroni and stir to incorporate before serving.
Enjoy!
