Shape squares of aluminum foil into cones by placing a finger in the center of the square, and folding up all the sides around it. You may use another square to wrap the cone up to create a smooth surface. Spray each cone well, and place on a baking sheet.
Slice the puff pastry into one-inch (2 ½cm) strips, and brush them with a little water to make them sticky.
Carefully coil the dough around each cone. Pinch off the tip to seal them.
Bake at 400˚F/ 204˚C for 15 minutes, or until the dough begins to tan, and the cone holds it’s shape.
While cones are baking, mix together pumpkin puree, sugar, evaporated milk, salt, pumpkin sauce, and eggs together.
Remove the foil, and place the cones upright in a small glass, or a popover pan.
Use a piping bag or spoon to fill the cones with pumpkin filling.
Bake again at 400˚F/204˚C for 30-45 minutes, or until the filling sets, and begins to darken. Bake time will vary depending on the size of you cones.
Allow the cones to cool for 20 minutes.
Top with whipped cream, or vanilla ice cream and pumpkin spice.
Enjoy!
