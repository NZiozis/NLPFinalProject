Chop the tempeh into chicken nugget-sized pieces and transfer to a mixing bowl.
Add the cornstarch, paprika, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, rice wine, and soy sauce to the bowl.
Mix until incorporated.
Cover and chill in fridge for 1 hour minimum.
Add oil to a pan on medium-high heat and pan-fry tempeh until browned on both sides.
Remove from pan.
In the same pan, add in oil and sesame oil on medium-high heat.
Add the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes, and cook until golden brown and aromatic, about 1 minute.
Add the tomato paste and vegetable broth, and stir until incorporated.
Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and honey, and stir until all are incorporated.
Add the cornstarch slurry (mix the cornstarch with the water in a small bowl until paste forms) into sauce mixture and stir until sauce thickens.
Return the tempeh to the pan and allow to incorporate with the sauce.
Top with sesame seeds (optional).
Enjoy!
