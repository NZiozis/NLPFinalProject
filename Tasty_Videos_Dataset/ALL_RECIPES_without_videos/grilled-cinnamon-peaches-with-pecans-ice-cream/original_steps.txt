Fire up the grill.
Cut peaches along the seam all the way around and remove pit from peaches.
Put a saucepan over medium heat, and add pecans. Heat the pecans until theyâ€™re lightly toasted and fragrant, stirring often.
Add butter and stir until melted then add the sugar and cinnamon, stirring until everything comes together and looks like a pecan pie sauce.
Using a pastry brush, spread the sauce all over the peach halves.
Slap them on the grill. Grill for 4-6 minutes per side, or until the peaches have softened and have nice grill marks.
Serve each grilled peach half with a scoop of ice cream.
Drizzle the pecans and sauce on top.
Enjoy!
