In a medium-sized pan, combine semisweet chocolate chips and heavy cream over low heat, mix until you achieve a smooth consistency.
Pour mixture into a bread pan.
Allow to sit in refrigerator for 1 hour or until mixture is solid.
With an ice cream scoop, form balls from the mixture (refreeze if truffle begins to melt).
Roll in cocoa powder for topping.
Enjoy!
