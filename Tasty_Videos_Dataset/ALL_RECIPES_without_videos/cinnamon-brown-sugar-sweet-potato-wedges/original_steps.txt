Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Cut sweet potato into wedges. Place in large bowl.
Heat up coconut oil in microwave in 15-second intervals until melted. Mix in brown sugar and cinnamon.
Pour mixture into large bowl of sweet potatoes wedges. Mix together until evenly coated.
Place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until soft. For best results, flip halfway.
While wedges are baking, prepare dipping sauce by combining ingredients in a small bowl and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Enjoy!
