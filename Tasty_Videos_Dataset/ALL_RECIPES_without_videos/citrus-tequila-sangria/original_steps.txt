Combine water and sugar in a saucepan, bring mixture to a boil, then remove from heat and let cool.
Squeeze fresh juice from 2 oranges, 2 lemons, and 4 limes into the cooled simple syrup, then stir.
Using a mesh sieve, strain the citrus simple syrup into a large pitcher.
Slice 1 orange, 1 lemon, 2 limes, and add the slices into the pitcher. Pour in tequila, wine, club soda, and give it all a good stir.
Serve with ice and garnish with a slice of fruit.
Enjoy!
