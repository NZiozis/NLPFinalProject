Fry the prawns with salt and pepper until theyâ€™ve just turned pink. Take out and set aside.
In the same pan, fry the garlic and green chili for a few minutes before stirring in the peas and Thai green curry paste.
Add the prawns and noodles and mix together for another couple of minutes.
Serve with a little lime juice squeezed over.
Enjoy!
