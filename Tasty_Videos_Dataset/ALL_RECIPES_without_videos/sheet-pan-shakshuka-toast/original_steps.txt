Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.
Arrange the bread slices on the wire rack, then bake for 8 minutes, until slightly toasted.
Heat the olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, until softened.
Add the red pepper and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened.
Add the garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, cayenne, chili powder, and tomatoes. Stir occasionally for 15 minutes, or until thickened.
Spoon the shakshuka sauce onto the bread. Spread evenly.
Make a small well in the center of the sauce on each slice of bread. Carefully add an egg to each well.
Season the eggs with salt and pepper.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until the egg whites are set and the yolks are cooked to your liking.
Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve warm.
Enjoy!
