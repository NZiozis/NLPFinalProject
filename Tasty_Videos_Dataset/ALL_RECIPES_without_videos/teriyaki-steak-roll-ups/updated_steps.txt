In a baking dish with the steak, mix the soy sauce, garlic, ginger, honey, lime juice, and Sriracha sauce (optional).
Lightly massage the marinade into the steak and cover.
Refrigerate 1-4 hours.
Place toothpicks in a bowl and pour water over toothpicks until completely submerged.
Water will prevent toothpicks from burning.
Once marinated, cut the steak into 8 equal rectangles.
You may need to pound the steak thinner if using a thicker cut.
Place a few slices of each of the vegetables on a slice of steak, making sure they are all about the same length.
Roll the steak up over the vegetables and secure it with a toothpick.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, pour in the leftover marinade and bring to a boil.
Boil for about one minute, take off the heat, and set aside to use as a glaze.
In a grill pan or on the grill over medium high heat, place your steak roll-ups and cook for 2-3 minutes.
Flip the roll over and use a heat-safe brush to brush the glaze on each roll.
Cook for about one minute longer and remove from heat.
Top with sesame seeds.
Enjoy!
