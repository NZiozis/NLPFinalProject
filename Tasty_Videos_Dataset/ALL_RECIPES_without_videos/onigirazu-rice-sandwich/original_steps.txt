Set the nori sheet on a clean work surface. Season the rice with a pinch of salt.
Place half of the rice in the center of the nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Place the cooked salmon and shiso leaf on top.
Top with the remaining rice, then wrap the nori into a square and flip upside down. Let rest about 1 minute.
Cut in half.
Enjoy!
