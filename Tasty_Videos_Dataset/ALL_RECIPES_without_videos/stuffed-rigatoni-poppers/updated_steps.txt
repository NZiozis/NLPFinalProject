Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat, season with a teaspoon of salt, then add the rigatoni.
Stir and cook until the pasta is al dente, about 5 minutes.
Drain the pasta and transfer to a large bowl.
Add the olive oil and stir to coat.
Set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, add the ground beef, remaining teaspoon of salt, the pepper, oregano, parsley, onion, garlic, and mozzarella.
Stir until combined.
Spoon the beef mixture into a zip top bag, seal the bag, and cut the corner to create a small opening.
Pipe the beef mixture into one side of the rigatoni, then flip and pipe the other side to fill.
Place the filled rigatoni on a baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes.
Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C).
Place the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs into 3 separate medium bowls.
Take a rigatoni and roll it in the flour to coat, shake off any excess flour.
Dip the rigatoni in the egg with a fork.
Finally, roll the rigatoni in the bread crumbs until coated.
Repeat with the remaining rigatoni.
Fry the rigatoni poppers 4 at a time until golden brown, about 4 minutes.
Drain on a wire rack or over paper towels.
Sprinkle with fresh parsley and Parmesan.
Serve with marinara sauce.
Enjoy!
