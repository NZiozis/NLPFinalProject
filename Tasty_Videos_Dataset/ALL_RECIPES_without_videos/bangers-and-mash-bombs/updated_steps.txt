NOTE: To make a brown onion, try adding ½ teaspoon of mixed herbs while cooking.
Mash together the potatoes, salt, pepper, cheese, butter, and onion.
Cut the sausages in half and surround them with a thin layer of mashed potato.
Lay out 3 bowls, each one containing a different coating: flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs.
Coat the croquette first in flour, then eggs, followed by breadcrumbs, then one more time in the eggs, and lastly breadcrumbs.
Heat the oil to 160°C (325˚F).
NOTE: If you don’t have a thermometer, you can test the oil by dropping in a small piece of white bread.
If it sizzles and browns within 45 seconds, the oil is ready.
Carefully deep-fry the bangers and mash bombs in small batches for a few minutes until golden brown.
Drain on a paper towel, sprinkle with salt, and serve with warm gravy.
Enjoy!
