Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a large bowl, add the roasted sweet potato, white beans, onion, parsley, lemon juice, and seasonings.
Using a potato masher, mash the ingredients until thoroughly mixed together.
Once mashed, add the bread crumbs and mix them in.
In a pan, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat.
Add the patties and cook for 3 minutes on each side.
Transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
Place patties on buns, and top with chipotle mayo, avocado, and red onion.
Enjoy!
