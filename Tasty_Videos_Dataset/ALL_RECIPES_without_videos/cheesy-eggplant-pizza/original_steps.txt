Preheat oven to 350°F/180˚C.
Slice the eggplant into ½-inch (1 ¼ cm) pieces.
Salt the slices and leave them to “sweat” for 20 minutes then wipe them off.
Slather each slice with olive oil.
Bake for 25 minutes.
In a medium bowl, combine all pizza sauce ingredients and stir until homogenous.
Remove eggplant slices from the oven and pour about 2 tablespoons of the sauce mixture onto each one.
Sprinkle mozzarella and cheddar on each slice.
Put the slices back in the oven for 1-2 minutes to melt the cheese.
Allow to cool before serving.
Enjoy!
