Make the dough: Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl.
Gradually pour in the water, stirring with chopsticks to incorporate.
Once the dough comes together in a ball, knead in the bowl for 5-8 minutes, until smooth.
Cover with a damp towel and let rest in the bowl for 30 minutes
Make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the pork, green onion, egg, salt, five spice, Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
Using chopsticks, mix until well combined.
Add the shrimp, wood ear mushrooms, and Napa cabbage.
Mix well.
On a lightly floured surface, turn out the dough and knead a few times.
Stretch the dough into a 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick ring, then cut to make a rope.
Divide the dough into 2-ounce (55 G) pieces, turning the rope 90 degrees after each cut to make triangle shapes.
Lightly flour the dough portions.
Working 1 at a time, pat each dough portion into a flat circle, then, using a small rolling pin, roll out into a thin circle.
Add 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of a dumpling wrapper.
Fold the wrapper in half.
Using your fingertips, make pleats to seal the dumpling.
Press the edges firmly to fully seal the dumpling.
Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the dumplings and cook for 10 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through
Serve immediately with dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
