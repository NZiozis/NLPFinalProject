Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Prepare each mason jar with oil or nonstick spray of choice to prevent sticking.
In a medium mixing bowl, add all ingredients.
Mix well.
Add the egg mixture to the jars, filling them ¾ of the way full.
Do not add the lids.
Place the mason jars on a small baking sheet and bake 25-30 minutes.
Remove jars from the oven, then cool 5-10 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
