Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Break the head of cauliflower into bite-sized florets.
In a large bowl, combine olive oil, salt and pepper.
Add the cauliflower and coat well.
Transfer cauliflower to an oiled, parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.
Remove from oven and squeeze the juice of one lemon over the florets. Adding the lemon juice in the beginning prevents the cauliflower from getting soggy. Top with some more cracked pepper if you prefer.
Bake for another 10 minutes or until heated through.
Serve with aioli or your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
