Combine the sweet rice flour, cornstarch, and water in a mixing bowl.
Turn out on table and knead to form a ball of dough.
Grab a ping pong size of dough, create a well and fill with chocolate chips.
Wrap the dough around the chocolate chips and form into a ball.
Make sure to seal well and push out any air pockets.
If you donâ€™t push out air pockets, they will pop and burst while frying.
Deep fry until the outside is crispy and the mochi balls start floating.
Enjoy!
