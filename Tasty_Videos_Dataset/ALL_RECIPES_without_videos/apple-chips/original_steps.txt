Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cut the apples into ⅛- to ¼-inch (3-to 6-mm) slices. Arrange on the baking sheet. Spray the slices with nonstick spray or brush with oil. Then, sprinkle with cinnamon.
Bake for 30 minutes, flipping halfway, until lightly golden brown. Let cool to room temperature.
Enjoy!
