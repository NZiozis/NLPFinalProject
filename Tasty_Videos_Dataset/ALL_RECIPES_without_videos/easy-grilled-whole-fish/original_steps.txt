Rinse fish inside and out with cold water, pat dry with paper towel.
Stuff cavity with salt, pepper, lemon, parsley, or any favorite herbs or spices.
Drizzle skin with olive oil. Place in a loose pouch of heavy duty aluminum foil and splash with white wine. Roll the foil shut so that liquid or air canâ€™t escape but leave a space between the top of the fish and the top of the foil pouch.
Cook on medium-high grill for 12-18 minutes depending on size of the fish.
Enjoy!
