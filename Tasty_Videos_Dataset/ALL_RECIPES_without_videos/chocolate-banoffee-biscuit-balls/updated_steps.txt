*”Toffee”/Dulce De Leche can be purchase already prepared - or can be made at home through a process of heating Sweetened Condensed Milk - Recipes/instructions can be found online.
Crush Digestive Biscuits in a large plastic bag.
Pour into a large bowl and add Banana and about half the can of Dulce De Leche.
Use a fork to mash and incorporate the banana and toffee into the biscuit crumbs.
Add additional Toffee as needed - just enough to coat all the biscuit crumbs without it becoming too sticky.
Form the mixture into 1 inch (2 ½ cm) balls and freeze for 15 minutes until firm.
Microwave chocolate for 60 Seconds - stopping after 30 seconds to check and stir.
Remove balls from freezer and dip into the melted chocolate.
Set on wax paper and sprinkle with additional biscuit crumbs (optional).
Allow chocolate coating to harden (chill in fridge to speed up this process).
Drizzle with additional toffee just before serving.
Enjoy!
