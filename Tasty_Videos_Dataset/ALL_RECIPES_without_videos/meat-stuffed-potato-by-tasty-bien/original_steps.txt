Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
In a bowl, mix the ground beef, egg, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper.
Take a piece of the meat mixture of about the size of a ping pong ball and slightly flatten it. Add a piece of mozzarella cheese in the center, and seal it with your hands.
Bake for 15 minutes.
Cover a meat ball with a layer of mashed potatoes, and mold it with your hands, continue molding it into a ball.
Dip the meatball in a bowl of flour. Repeat with remaining meatballs.
Heat the oil to 350ºF (180ºC). Fry the mashed potato-covered meatballs in batches until golden brown.
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve with marinara sauce.
Enjoy!
