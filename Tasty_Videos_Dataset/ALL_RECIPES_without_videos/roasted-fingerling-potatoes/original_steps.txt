Place the potatoes in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 5-7 minutes, then drain in a colander.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Thoroughly dry the par-boiled potatoes with a paper towel.
On a cutting board, quarter the potatoes.
Place the potatoes in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and rosemary, stirring until well-coated.
Transfer the potatoes to a parchment-lined baking sheet and spread in an even layer.
Roast for 35-45 minutes, until crispy.
Enjoy!
