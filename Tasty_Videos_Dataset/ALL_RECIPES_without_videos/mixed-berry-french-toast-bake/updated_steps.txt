Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Slice bread into quarters.
Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine honey and warm water.
Whisk until the honey dissolves.
Add milk, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt.
Whisk until well-combined.
Pour the bread into a greased 9x13 (23x33 cm) baking dish.
Top with the egg mixture.
Toss the bread and egg mixture together to evenly coat the bread.
Let the bread soak for 20 minutes.
Add the blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries evenly on top of the bread.
Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden brown and slightly crispy around the edges and top.
NOTE: Times & temperatures may vary based on oven.
Serve with maple syrup on top (optional).
Enjoy!
