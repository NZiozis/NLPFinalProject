Cut your sausage into slivers and brown in a pan on medium, with oil. Once cooked, set aside.
Add your diced onion into the pan and brown them before adding your can of whole tomatoes, curry, paprika, mustard, and chili powder. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Stew the ingredients together, mashing the whole tomatoes, and let simmer on low for 20 minutes.
Place your sausage onto your Hawaiian rolls, top with your relish and finish with a sprinkle of curry powder.
Enjoy!
