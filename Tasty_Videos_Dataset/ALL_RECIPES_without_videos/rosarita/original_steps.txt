In a pitcher or large bowl, add tequila, lime juice, simple syrup, and rosé. Stir to combine.
Pour the Himalayan salt into a shallow dish. Wet the rim of the servings glasses, and dip each into the salt.
Add ice to each serving glass (optional), then top with the rosé margarita (rosarita).
Serve with a lime wedge.
Enjoy!
