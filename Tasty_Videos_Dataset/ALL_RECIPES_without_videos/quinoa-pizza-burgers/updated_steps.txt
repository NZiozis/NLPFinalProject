Preheat oven to 400˚F/200˚C.
In a large bowl add the quinoa, beans, tomato, paste, and seasonings.
Using a potato masher, mash the ingredients until thoroughly mixed together.
Take a quarter of quinoa-bean mixture and shape it into a patty using your hands.
Repeat with the remaining mixture to create four patties.
Place the patties on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Top with mozzarella, and bake for 12-15 minutes.
Place the patties on buns, and top with tomato sauce, shredded Parmesan, and fresh basil.
Enjoy!
