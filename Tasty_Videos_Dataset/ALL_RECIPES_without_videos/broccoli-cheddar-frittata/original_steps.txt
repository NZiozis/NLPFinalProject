In a medium bowl, beat the eggs.
Add the broccoli, cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder and beat to combine.
Heat the mini frying pan over medium heat.
Pour the egg mixture into the pan and cover with a small plate.
Cook for 10 minutes, or until the egg is set.
Transfer to a plate and top with sliced chives.
Enjoy!
