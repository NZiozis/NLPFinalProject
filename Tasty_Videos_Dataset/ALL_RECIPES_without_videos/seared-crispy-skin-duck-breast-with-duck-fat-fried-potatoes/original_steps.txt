Pat dry the duck breasts with a paper towel.
Score the duck skin with sharp knife, making sure to not cut into the flesh.
Season the duck breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.
Add the potatoes to a pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook for 15-20 minutes, until fork-tender. Drain the potatoes in a colander.
Using the bottom of a ramekin or your palm, gently smash the potatoes.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Starting with a cold and dry oven-safe skillet, place the duck breasts skin side down. Cook for 12-15 minutes over medium heat.
Flip the breasts over and sear the other side for 1 minute. Flip to the skin side down, and transfer the skillet to the oven.
Roast for 4 minutes for medium-rare, or 6 minutes for medium.
Rest the duck skin-side up for 10 minutes. Do not discard the fat in the pan.
In a small pot, combine the red wine, chicken stock, orange juice, and honey and reduce by half over medium heat.
Fry the potatoes with remaining duck fat in the pan, until golden brown, 5-6 minutes. Season with salt, pepper and rosemary.
Slice the duck ½-inch (1 cm) pieces.
Serve with the sauce and the potatoes.
Enjoy!
