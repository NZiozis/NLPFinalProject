In a bowl, add the olive oil, Greek yogurt, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, honey, poppy seeds, mustard, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and whisk until emulsified.
Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken and cook until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side.
Once cooled, slice the chicken on a cutting board.
Toss spinach, strawberries, avocado, almonds, and sliced chicken together in a large bowl and drizzle with poppy seed dressing.
Enjoy!
