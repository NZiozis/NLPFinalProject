Beat the eggs into the buttermilk.
Add the chicken pieces to the buttermilk mixture and chill for an hour.
In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour with all the herbs and spices.
Coat the soaked chicken pieces in the herbed flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
Heat oil in a large sauce pan to 325˚F (170°C), then turn to low heat.
Fry the chicken in batches for 15 minutes until the chicken is cooked and the skins turn golden brown.
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Enjoy!
