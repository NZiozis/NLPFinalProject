In a sauce pan, over medium-high heat, combine all taquito filling ingredients.
Mix well and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Wrap tortillas in a damp towel and microwave for 15-20 seconds.
Place about 2 tablespoons of filling across the tortilla about ⅓ of the way up from the bottom of the tortilla, and roll the tortilla around the filling.
Heat about ¼ inch (½ cm) of oil over medium-high heat.
Carefully, place 3-4 taquitos in the oil, and cook for 3 minutes on each side.
(Frying them seam side down first helps them stay closed during frying!)
Remove from the pan and drain excess oil on the taquito on a paper towel.
Place cooked taquitos on a bed of lettuce and garnish with crema, cilantro, cotija, and avocado.
Enjoy!
