In a large pitcher, combine the strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, brut ros√©, and triple sec. Stir and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.
When ready to serve, remove the pitcher from the refrigerator and add the lemon lime soda. Gently stir to combine.
Place 1-2 small scoops of blackberry sorbet in a glass. Pour the sangria over the sorbet and stir with a spoon.
Garnish with a fresh strawberry.
Enjoy!
