In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar and water.
Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar completely.
Add the blueberries to the pot and boil until the berries begin to burst, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and cool for 5â€“10 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth.
Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine the bourbon, lemon juice, and simple syrup.
Shake vigorously for 20 seconds.
Strain into a glass filled with ice and top with ginger beer.
Garnish with lemon wedge.
Enjoy!
