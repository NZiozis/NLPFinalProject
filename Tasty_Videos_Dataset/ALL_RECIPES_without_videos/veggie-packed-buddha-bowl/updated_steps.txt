Preheat the oven to 325°F (170°C).
Make the dressing: Use a knife to slice off the top third of the head of garlic, just enough so that all of the cloves are exposed but the head remains intact.
Fill a small ovenproof saucepan with the olive oil and place the garlic bulb, cut side down, in the oil.
Cover the pan with a lid and transfer to the oven.
Bake for 40 minutes, until the garlic has softened and is easily pierced with a paring knife.
Let cool.
Once the garlic and oil have cooled enough to handle, squeeze the cloves out of the garlic skin into a blender.
Add the salt, pepper, water, lemon juice, and mustard to the blender.
Puree until smooth.
With the blender still running, slowly add the oil from the saucepan in a steady stream.
The dressing should be a creamy and slightly thick.
Set aside.
In a medium bowl, season the chicken with turmeric, onion powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.
Toss until evenly coated.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the chicken to the pan and sauté until firm and cooked through, about 4 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat.
To build the buddha bowls, divide the rice between 2 serving bowls.
Top with shredded cabbage, sliced avocado, turmeric chicken, shredded carrots, halved cherry tomatoes, and green onions and drizzle with roasted garlic dressing.
Enjoy!
