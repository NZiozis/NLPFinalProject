In the bowl of a food processor, add the walnuts, and pulse until coarsely ground.
Add the flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt, and pulse until finely ground.
Add the butter and pulse until the mixture comes together and holds when compressed.
Press the mixture into a 9-inch (23-cm) round tart pan.
Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork.
Freeze for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚F).
Bake for 20-25 minutes.
Add the blueberries and water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until most of the blueberries have burst, about 5 minutes.
Strain the blueberry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl.
Add the blueberry juice, eggs, egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch to a medium saucepan over low heat, whisking constantly.
Once the mixture is warmed through, add the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking until melted and incorporated.
Continue whisking until the curd begins to thicken, 5-8 minutes.
Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.
Whisk in the olive oil.
Pour the blueberry curd into the par baked tart shell, and bake for 15 minutes.
Chill the tart in the refrigerator overnight.
Slice the kiwis into desired shapes and arrange on top of the chilled tart.
Enjoy!
