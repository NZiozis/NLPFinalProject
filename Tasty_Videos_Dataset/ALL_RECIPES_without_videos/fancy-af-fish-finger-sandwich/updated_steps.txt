Cut the cod fillet into 6-7 big finger shapes.
Mix the Parmesan with the panko breadcrumbs.
Coat the fish fingers with flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.
Deep fry the fish fingers in 170˚C (325˚F) hot oil for about 2-3 minutes or until they turn golden brown and are cooked through.
Set aside.
Mix all the sauce ingredients well, set aside.
Spread a thick layer of the tartar sauce onto a soft and fluffy slice of bread.

Finish with a drizzle of ketchup and more Tartar.
Top with another slice of bread and serve.
Enjoy!
