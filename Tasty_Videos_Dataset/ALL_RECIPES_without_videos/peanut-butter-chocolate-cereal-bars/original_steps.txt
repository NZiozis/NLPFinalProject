Pour the peanut butter and honey into a bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals until melted.
Mix in the corn flakes, puffed rice cereal, and raisins.
Transfer mixture to a parchment-lined 8x8inch (20x20cm) baking pan. Top with mini chocolate chips (optional).
Chill until firm.
Cut bars into sizes of your choice, wrap in parchment paper, and store in a sealed ziplock in the fridge or freezer for up to 3 months.
Enjoy!
