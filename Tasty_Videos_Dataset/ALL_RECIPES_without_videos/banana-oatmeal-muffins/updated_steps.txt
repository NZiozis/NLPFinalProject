Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a medium bowl, mash bananas.
Mix eggs, maple syrup, salt, baking powder, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and Greek yogurt into mixture.
Add oats and milk, and mix.
Let the mixture sit for a few minutes, so the oats soak up the liquid and the consistency is like oatmeal.
Line muffin tins with muffin liners.
Pour the mixture into each muffin cup about ¾ full.
Add your preferred toppings and gently push your toppings into each muffin cup.
Bake for 30 minutes.
Let cool for 5 minutes before eating.
Once cool, you can also store in an airtight container or freeze in a storage bag.
Enjoy!
