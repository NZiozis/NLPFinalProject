Steep the lavender in the hot water for 7 minutes.
Froth the milk by adding it to a resealable jar.
Shake vigorously until many bubbles form.
Then, microwave the milk for 45 seconds to 1 minute, which will help create stable bubbles.
Remove the lavender, then stir in the agave and frothed milk.
Top with more lavender, if desired.
Enjoy!
