With a hand-mixer, beat for 3-5 minutes, or until frothy.
Add half of the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture.
Fold until incorporated.
Add remaining half and repeat.

Place ramekins onto a baking tray.
Place tray onto the top oven rack.
Fill the bottom of the baking tray with an inch (2 ½ cm) of water.

Let cool before serving.
Garnish to your liking.
Enjoy!
