Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Cut pineapple in half lengthwise, cutting from root through the leaves.
Hollow out the pineapple by slicing around the perimeter, leaving a ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) border.
Slice the pineapple inside the cut border, and scoop out with a spoon.
Repeat with the other half and set aside, as this will be the serving bowl for the salmon.
Add pineapple and water to a blender and blend until smooth.
Pour pineapple purée into a saucepan set over medium heat.
Add sugar, chile flakes, salt, and garlic to the pan and bring to a simmer.
Stir frequently until sauce has become lighter in color and slightly thickened.
In a separate small bowl, combine cornstarch with water to make a slurry.
Add the slurry to the sauce, cooking until sauce has thickened, about 4-7 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat.
Place the salmon on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and cover each fillet with the sauce
Bake for 12-15 minutes, depending on your desired doneness.
Serve in the pineapple bowls over rice with extra pineapple sweet chile sauce on the side.
Enjoy!
