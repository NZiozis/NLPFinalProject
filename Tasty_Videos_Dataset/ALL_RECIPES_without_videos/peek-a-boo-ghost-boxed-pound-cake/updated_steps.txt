Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Line a 8x4-inch (20x10 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper and generously grease the pan.
Slice the vanilla pound cake as the same thickness as a ghost shaped cookie cutter.
Cut out the cake with using a ghost-shaped cookie cutter.
Set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine pound cake mix, cocoa powder, butter, melted chocolate, milk, and eggs.
Mix until well combined.
In the lined and greased loaf pan, add ⅓ of the batter.
Line the cut out ghost-shaped pound cake in the middle of the pan.
Pour rest of the batter over the ghost-shaped cake.
Smooth the top and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until inserted toothpick comes out clean.
Cool completely on cooling rack
Enjoy!
