Roughly chop half of shrimp and finely chop the rest until it becomes a paste.
Place the shrimp and tofu in a medium bowl and break up with a spatula.
Add the mayonnaise, salt, and pepper.
Mix well.
Using your hands, form the shrimp mixture into 2 patties.
Place the flour, eggs, and panko in 3 separate medium bowls.
Dredge the shrimp patties in the flour, then egg, then panko bread crumbs.
Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C).
Fry the shrimp patties until golden brown, then drain on paper towels.
Line a ramekin with plastic wrap, and mold a quarter of the rice into a patty.
Repeat with the remaining rice to make 4 "buns".
In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat a splash of sesame oil, then add the rice buns.
Cook, flipping once, until the outside is crispy.
Make the tartar sauce: In a small bowl, combine the boiled egg, mayonnaise, pickles, and onions.
Assemble the burgers: start with the rice “bun,” then add the green leaf lettuce, shrimp katsu burger, a dollop of tartar sauce, and top with another rice “bun.”
Enjoy!
