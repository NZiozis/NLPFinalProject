Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Add butternut squash, Brussels sprouts, and red onion to to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Season with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and use hands to mix until seasoning is fully distributed.
Bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
In a medium saucepan, add lentils and water, and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer and cover for 20-25 minutes or until lentils are tender. Drain excess water if necessary.
When vegetables are finished roasting, transfer to a mixing bowl and add lentils.
For the dressing, combine balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, salt, and pepper in liquid measuring cup and whisk until combined.
Pour dressing over lentils and vegetables and toss until fully coated.
Transfer lentil salad to two containers and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
Enjoy!
