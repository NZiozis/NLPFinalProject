In a large bowl, combine the heavy cream and the sugar, beating with an electric mixer until soft peaks form when lifted from the bowl.
Set aside two large spoonfuls of the whipped cream to garnish with at the end.
Whisk the chocolate and hot cream in a separate bowl until smooth, then fold in the mixture into the cream with a spatula until no streaks remain.
Split the chocolate cream mixture evenly between two martini glasses or your serving dish of choice, then chill for at least 1 hour.
Garnish with a spoonful of whipped cream, raspberries, mint, and the chocolate cookie.
Enjoy!
