Cut the beef into cubes, then season generously with salt and pepper.
Heat the canola oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium high heat. Working in batches, sear the beef on all sides until well browned. Do not overcrowd the pan. Transfer the meat to a plate and set aside.
Add the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic to the pan and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the tomato paste to the center of the pot and cook for 1 minute. Stir the tomato paste into the vegetables and continue cooking until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.
Add the beef stock and tomatoes and stir to combine, then add the rosemary, thyme, pepper, salt, and bay leaf. Return the beef to the pot, making sure it is submerged in the braising liquid.
Bring to a boil, then cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 3 hours.
Shred larger pieces of beef with a fork or tongs. Serve the braised beef and sauce over cooked egg noodles.
Enjoy!
