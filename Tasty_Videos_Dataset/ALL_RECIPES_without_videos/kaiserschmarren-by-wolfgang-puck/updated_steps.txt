Position a rack in the center of the oven.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
Separate egg yolk and egg whites into 2 bowls.
Meanwhile, put the raisins and rum in a small bowl and steep for about 10 minutes.
Put the crème fraîche, ½ cup sugar (100 G), egg yolks, raisins, and 1 tablespoon of the rum in a mixing bowl.
Whisk until blended.
Stir in the flour.
Put the egg whites in a large, clean mixing bowl.
Add the cream of tartar and salt.
With a hand-held electric mixer on medium speed, beat until thick and foamy.
Then, still beating, gradually add 1 cup (200 G) of sugar.
Continue beating until soft peaks form when the beaters are lifted out.
Drop a large scoop of the meringue onto the egg yolk batter.
With a flexible rubber spatula, gently fold the whites into the batter to lighten it.
Scoop the remaining meringue over the batter and gently fold it in.
Coat a medium ovenproof skillet with the butter.
Sprinkle in sugar and shake and rotate to coat the butter.
Tap out any excess.
Gently scrape the batter into the prepared skillet.
Smooth the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed, golden brown on top, and springy to a gentle touch at its center, 10 to 12 minutes.
While the batter bakes, in a nonreactive skillet stir together the berries, lemon juice, ¼ cup (50 G) sugar, orange juice and zest, vanilla, and star anise.
Cook over medium-low heat, stirring to help the sugar dissolve and mashing a few of the berries to help thicken the sauce.
Divide the compote among serving plates.
With a large serving spoon, scoop up large dollops of the Kaiserschmarren, distributing them evenly on top of the compote.
Dust generously with confectioners sugar.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
