Remove dough from package and roll out on lightly floured surface to desired size.
Add alternating rows of pepperoni, mozzarella, and salami until dough is covered, leaving 1½ inches (4 cm) of space along the outside of the dough.
Add the roasted red pepper, shredded mozzarella, red pepper flakes, and oregano on top of meat and cheese.
Roll up the stromboli slowly.
Combine melted butter, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper.
Brush the butter mixture onto the stromboli, evenly coating each side.
Bake stromboli at 400˚F (200˚C) until golden brown (about 15-20 minutes).
Enjoy!
