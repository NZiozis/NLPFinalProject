Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a small bowl, mix together the honey, soy sauce, ginger, salt, and pepper until combined.
Set aside.
On a parchment-lined baking sheet, arrange the yellow squash, red onion, bell pepper, asparagus, and salmon fillets in rows in an even layer.
Drizzle oil on the yellow squash, red onion, bell pepper, and asparagus, and season with salt and pepper.
Pour the honey ginger sauce over the salmon fillets.
Bake for 15 minutes, until the salmon is cooked and the veggies have softened slightly.
Plate salmon with veggies on the side and serve.
Enjoy!
