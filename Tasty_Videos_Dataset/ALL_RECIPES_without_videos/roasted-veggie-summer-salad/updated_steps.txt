Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, add carrots, potatoes, yellow squash, and zucchini.
Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic, and mix to evenly coat the coat the vegetables.
*Note: You may need to quarter the potatoes if they are too thick so they roast faster.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the vegetables are golden brown.
Make the chimichurri dressing: combine the cilantro, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, olive oil, lime juice, and red wine vinegar in a food processor and blend until smooth.
Add a large handful of greens to a large bowl.
Top with the roasted vegetables and sliced radishes.
Pour over the chimichurri dressing and toss until evenly distributed.
Enjoy!
