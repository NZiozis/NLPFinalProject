Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).
In a large bowl, mix together the crushed tomatoes, water, olive oil, basil, oregano, garlic, salt, pepper, and fusilli.
Pour the pasta mixture into a greased roasting pan and smooth the top into an even layer.
Line the top of the mixture with the sliced tomatoes and sprinkle with salt.
Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes, until the pasta is fully cooked. Serve and sprinkle with garnish of choice.
Enjoy!
