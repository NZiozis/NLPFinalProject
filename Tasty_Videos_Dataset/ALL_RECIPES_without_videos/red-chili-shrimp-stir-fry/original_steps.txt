Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Pour in the shrimp and season with ¼ teaspoon of the salt.
Fry the shrimp for 1 minute on each side.
Remove the shrimp from the pan and pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.
Toss in the red bell pepper, remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt, and red pepper flakes and sauté for a few minutes until they begin to soften.
Add in the soy sauce and sauté about 1 more minute.
Toss the shrimp back into the pan and mix until everything is well incorporated and the shrimp is fully cooked, about 1 minute.
Divide the mixture evenly between 4 bowls and top with green onion.
Enjoy!
