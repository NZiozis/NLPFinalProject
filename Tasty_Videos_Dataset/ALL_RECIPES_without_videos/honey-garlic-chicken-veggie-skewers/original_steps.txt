Soak the skewers in water for 5-10 minutes and set aside.
If baking, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a bowl with the chicken, add the ingredients for the marinade.
Mix until coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Prepare the vegetables by cutting them into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) squares.
Assemble the skewers starting with the red onion, followed by the bell peppers and chicken. Repeat three times.
Place the prepared skewers on a baking sheet and brush with remaining marinade.
Bake or grill for 20-30 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink.
Sprinkle with parsley.
Enjoy!
