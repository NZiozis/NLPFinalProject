Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set a wire rack inside.
Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel. Generously season the chicken on both sides with the herb salt, rubbing underneath the skin. Let sit for 15-20 minutes to draw out the moisture from the chicken skin, which will result in crispier chicken.
After resting, pat the chicken thighs dry once more to remove any excess moisture. Drizzle the olive oil under the skin and rub into the chicken.
Place the chicken thighs skin-side up on the wire rack. Bake for 30 minutes, until the skin is crispy and the internal temperature reaches 155-160˚F (68-71˚C).
Let the thighs rest for 15 minutes to bring the internal temperature to 165˚F (75˚C) and to let the juices settle.
Enjoy!
