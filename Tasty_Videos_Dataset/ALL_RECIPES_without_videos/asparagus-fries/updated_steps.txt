Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Cut off about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of asparagus ends.
Set aside.
In a large bowl combine crushed almonds, parmesan, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper.
Whisk eggs in a shallow bowl or dish.
Dip asparagus in eggs, coating evenly, and then toss with the crushed almond mixture.
Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper in a single layer.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway.
Prepare dip while fries are baking.
Combine all dip ingredients in a small bowl and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Enjoy!
