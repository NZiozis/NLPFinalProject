Grate the broccoli with a coarse cheese grater.
Transfer the grated bits to a medium bowl and season with a ¼ teaspoon of the salt. Mix the broccoli until well incorporated.
Let the broccoli sit for 20 minutes until the salt has drawn out some of the moisture.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Pour the broccoli into a clean kitchen towel and twist to strain as much liquid as you can.
Place the grated broccoli back into a bowl and mix with the breadcrumbs, chives, cheddar, garlic, remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt, pepper, and egg, and mix until well combined.
Form the mixture into 15 even sized tots and transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20-24 minutes, flipping each halfway through.
Serve with your choice of dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
