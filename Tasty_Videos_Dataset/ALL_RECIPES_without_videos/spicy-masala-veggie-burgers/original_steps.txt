Finely chop two red potatoes, and two large carrots. Saut√© in a little oil for a few minutes.
Add the bell pepper, corn, and edamame. Continue to cook until the potatoes are soft.
In a food processor, grind the oats until they are a grainy powder.
Add the veggies, olive oil, and spices. Blend.
Shape the mixture into patties, and fry, grill, bake, or freeze them for later!
Serve with toppings of choice! (Topping in this video: Vegan mayo, mustard, ketchup, dill pickles, onion, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado.)
Enjoy!
