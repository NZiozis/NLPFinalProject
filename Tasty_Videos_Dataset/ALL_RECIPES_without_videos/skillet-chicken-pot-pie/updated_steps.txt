Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
Debone, remove skin, and shred rotisserie chicken.
Melt butter in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
Add in the flour and stir until bubbling.
Whisk in the milk until smooth, then add chicken, frozen peas and carrots, potato, and cream.
Stir until fully mixed and bubbling.
Drape pie crust over the top of the skillet and cut 4 venting holes in the center.
Bake for 30-35 min, or until crust is golden brown.
Carefully remove from the oven.
Enjoy!
