In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, sauté the chorizo until cooked through for about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chorizo to a paper towel-lined plate and add the butter to the pan.
When the butter is melted, turn off the heat and whisk in the paprika.
In a medium bowl, combine the cheese, garlic, chives, and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Roll the pizza dough pieces into balls.
Dip each ball in the chorizo butter and toss in the cheese mixture to coat.
Lightly grease a 9-inch (23 cm) cast iron skillet and add the balls and chorizo to the pan. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and set aside to rise in a warm, draft-free space for 30 to 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375°F (190˚C).
Bake the bread until golden and bubbling for 30 to 35 minutes.
Enjoy!
