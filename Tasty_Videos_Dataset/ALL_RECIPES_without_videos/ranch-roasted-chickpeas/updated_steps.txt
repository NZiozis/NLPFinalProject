Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Carefully dry the chickpeas.
Removing the skins is optional and they will come off easily.
The drier you get them, the crunchier they’ll be!
In a medium bowl, add dried chickpeas, olive oil, thyme, parsley, onion, dill, garlic powder and pepper.
Toss well to coat evenly.
Spread chickpeas out on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Roast for 15-20 minutes.
Mix around on baking sheet and roast for additional 15-20 minutes, or until golden.
Cool for 5-10 minutes.
Enjoy!
