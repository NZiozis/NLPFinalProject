In a bowl, whisk together the strawberries and double cream until they reach soft peaks.
Sieve the flour and cocoa powder into a bowl. Crack an egg in the middle and add the melted butter. Whisk until combined.
Slowly add the milk in three batches, whisking until perfectly smooth.
Heat a small amount of butter over low heat in a nonstick frying pan.
Pour in half of the mixture and swirl around until the pan is fully covered. When you can see bubbles forming underneath the crepe, flip. Cook until the edges start to look dry and crisp.
Repeat cooking steps with the remaining mixture and set aside to cool.
Spread the strawberry cream onto one crepe and chocolate hazelnut spread on the other.
Put the chocolate crepe on top of the strawberry one. Cut into 8 slices with a pizza cutter. Layer them on top of each other.
Serve with strawberries and crushed hazelnuts.
Enjoy!
