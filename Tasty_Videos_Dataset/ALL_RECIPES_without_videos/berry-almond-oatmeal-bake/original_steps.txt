Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a bowl, whisk wet ingredients until combined.
In a separate bowl, combine dry ingredients.
Spread 1 cup (100 grams) of berries over the bottom of an 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) glass baking dish. Add dry mixture, then wet mixture, then the remaining berries. Top with sliced almonds.
Bake 40-45 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
Top with honey.
Enjoy!
