Preheat the oven to 180˚C (350˚F).
Cut the rashers in half lengthwise, and roll the sausages in them.
Set aside.
Lay out the sheet of puff pastry and coat with some egg wash.
Cut into 12 squares.
In each square, sprinkle on some cheese, followed by a sausage wrapped in bacon.
Roll in the pastry.
Pierce some holes on top of each roll and coat with more egg wash. Top with black onion seeds.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown and the sausages are cooked through.
Enjoy!
