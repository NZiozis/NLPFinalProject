Combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar in a bowl and stir to combine. Add the salmon and marinate for 15 minutes.
For the sauce, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar in a bowl and stir to combine.
Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a splash of salad oil. Add the marinated salmon and cook until both sides are cooked through, about 3 minutes.
Add the reserved marinade to the pan. Stir until the salmon is fully coated in the glaze.
Form the rice into four patties.
Heat another pan over medium-high heat and add the sesame oil. Add the rice “buns” and cook until the outside is crispy, about 5 minutes.
Top the rice "bun" with a piece of green leaf lettuce, salmon, mayonnaise, and top with another rice “bun.” Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Enjoy!
