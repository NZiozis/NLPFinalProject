Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
Grease a bundt pan.
Combine apples, butter, brown sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and cornstarch in a large saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples have browned and softened and sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes. Drain excess sauce into a separate bowl. Set aside.
Cut each biscuit in half and flatten into rounds.
Stuff each round with a tablespoon of apples.
Close the round together by pinching at the seam and roll into ball using your hands.
Layer half of the balls in the pan and spoon half of the reserved sauce on top. Repeat with remaining balls and sauce.
Bake for 30 minutes. Cover with foil and bake for additional 10-15 minutes.
Cool for 15 minutes.
Whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk, until you reach a smooth consistency. Drizzle over bread.
Removing bread from the pan and drizzle with icing.
Enjoy!
