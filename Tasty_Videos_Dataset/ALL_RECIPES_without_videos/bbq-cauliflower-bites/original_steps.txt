Preheat oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Cut the head of cauliflower in half. Pluck bite-sized florets from each half. Trim bottoms of florets as necessary.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread cauliflower florets on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake for 20 minutes.
Remove florets from oven and toss with BBQ sauce.
Return florets to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes until browned to your liking.
Brush more BBQ sauce on the cooked cauliflower for extra flavor.
Enjoy!
