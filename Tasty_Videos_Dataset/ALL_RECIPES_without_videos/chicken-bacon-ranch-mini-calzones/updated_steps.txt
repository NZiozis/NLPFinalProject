Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Cut pizza dough into 8 sections on a floured surface.
With one section, roll out dough until flat and circular.
In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken, ranch packet, red onion, and bacon.
Place a slice of mozzarella on the rolled out dough.
Top with 2-3 tablespoons of the chicken mixture.
Fold one side of dough up and over ingredients, and seal calzone by crimping the edges together.
Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Apply egg wash to outside of calzone and sprinkle with cheddar cheese.
Bake calzones at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Enjoy!
