Make the crispy chickpeas: Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a medium bowl, combine the chickpeas, curry powder, garlic powder, onion powder, coriander, turmeric, and salt, and toss to coat the chickpeas. Transfer the chickpeas to a small baking sheet and spread in an even layer.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until the chickpeas are crispy. Remove from the oven and let cool.
Make the soup: Increase the oven temperature to 450˚F (220˚C).
Add the cauliflower florets to a medium bowl with the melted coconut oil, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat, then transfer the cauliflower to a baking sheet.
Roast for 25 minutes, until browned and tender.
Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and jalapeño, and cook until the onion begins to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 2 minutes more, until the garlic is toasted and fragrant.
Add the curry paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve. Add the coconut milk and vegetable broth and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.
Add the roasted cauliflower to a blender with the broth and puree until smooth.
Ladle the soup into bowls. Top with the crispy chickpeas, scallions, and cilantro, and serve with lime wedges.
Enjoy!
