Combine the rice with 2 tablespoons of curry sauce.
Mix in the flour, cheese, 1 egg yolk, and pepper.
Roll into balls, make a well in the middle and place in some curry chicken.
Secure the ball by rolling it in your hands again.
Coat in the flour, egg yolk, breadcrumbs, then egg yolk, then breadcrumbs again.
Heat the oil in a pan to 160°C (325°F).
Fry the arancini for a few minutes, until golden brown.
Enjoy!
