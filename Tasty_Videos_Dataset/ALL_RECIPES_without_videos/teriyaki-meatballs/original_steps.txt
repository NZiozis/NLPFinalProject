Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a medium-size bowl mix together the beef, pork, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, garlic, eggs, salt, and pepper until just combined.
Take a walnut size of the meat mixture and roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining meat and transfer to an oiled rack on a sheet tray.
Bake meatballs for 15 minutes, until golden brown. Set aside.
In a pan on medium high heat, add the mirin, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sugar. Stir the mixture and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes.
Add the meatballs and coat them with the sauce.
Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and scallions, poke with toothpicks, and serve!
Enjoy!
