Preheat oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Place the rice in a sieve and rinse under cold water to remove excess starch.
Transfer the rice to a small pot with salt and water and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce to a simmer, put a lid on, and cook until water is absorbed, about 45 minutes.
In a bowl, add the skirt steak, red onion, bell pepper, lime juice, onion powder, chili powder, black pepper, and remaining salt and toss until well combined.
Transfer to a parchment paper-lined sheet tray and bake for 12 to 15 minutes.
Serve steak over rice and top with cilantro and lime wedges.
Enjoy!
