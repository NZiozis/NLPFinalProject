In a large bowl, combine the eggs, pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cream, vanilla, milk, and salt.
Whisk until smooth.
Add the cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg, and whisk to incorporate.
Set aside.
Lightly grease a 9x13-inch (22x33 cm) baking dish with nonstick spray.
Add the cubed bread to the dish in an even layer, then pour the pumpkin mixture on top.
Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, or for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator, to let the bread to soak up the liquid.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Just before baking, toss the bread cubes to redistribute the liquid.
Cover and bake for about 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for another 30 minutes, until the pudding is set and beginning to brown.
Top with the pecans and candied ginger.
Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.
Enjoy!
