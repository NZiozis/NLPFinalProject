Peel the apple and slice into 2 cm (Â¾-inch) thickness.
Using a teaspoon, cut out the core of the apple and place apples in a medium bowl.
Mix in cinnamon and coat each apple ring.
In a large bowl, mix egg, butter, vanilla extract, and milk with a whisk.
Sift in flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt, and mix the batter.
It is okay to leave lumps.
Heat pan on medium heat and melt butter.
Dunk each ring into the batter and place on pan.
Wait until bubbles form on the batter, then flip.
Top it off with your favorite toppings.
Enjoy!
