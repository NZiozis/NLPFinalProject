On a cutting board, halve the lemons and coat the cut sides with a thin layer of sugar.
Place the lemons on an 11" griddle pan cut side down and cook them over medium-high heat for 6-8 minutes, until caramelized.
Remove lemons from the griddle and rest them for 5-10 minutes.
Juice lemons over a fine mesh strainer into a half gallon (2 liter) pitcher.
Once all the lemons are juiced, add the white sugar, lemon rings, water, and ice (see note).
Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
NOTE: Do not add the ice if preparing ahead of time.
Add the ice immediately before serving.
Enjoy!
