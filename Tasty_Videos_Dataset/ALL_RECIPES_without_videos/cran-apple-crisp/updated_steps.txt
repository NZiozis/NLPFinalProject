Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a large bowl, gently combine apples, lemon juice, cranberries, cornstarch, sugar, syrup, and cinnamon.
Pour into a 9x13-inch (23x33cm) baking dish and bake for 30 minutes.
In another bowl, combine oats, brown sugar, flour, butter, and salt until well-incorporated.
Sprinkle the oat topping evenly over the baked fruit and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
Serve with ice cream on top.
Enjoy!
