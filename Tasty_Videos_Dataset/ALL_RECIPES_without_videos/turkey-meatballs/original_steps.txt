Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
Add the turkey, breadcrumbs, egg, salt, pepper, and olive oil to a bowl and mix to combine.
Form the meat into 15 meatballs approximately 2-inches (5cm) across.
Place the meatballs on a parchment paper-lined tray and bake for 15-20 mins in the oven, or until cooked through.
Enjoy!
