Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, add the green beans, potatoes, and lemon.
Drizzle the vegetables with 2 teaspoons of olive oil and season with salt, pepper, paprika, rosemary, thyme, and garlic.
Mix until evenly coated.
Add the bell pepper halves to the center of the baking sheet and drizzle with the remaining teaspoon of olive oil, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ½ teaspoon of pepper.
Roast for 20 minutes until vegetables are golden brown.
Let cool.
Make the tuna salad: combine the tuna, celery, Greek yogurt, salt, pepper, and parsley in a medium bowl.
Add a large handful of greens to 2 bowls.
Divide the roasted vegetables and bell pepper halves between the bowls.
Add a hard-boiled egg, if desired.
Scoop the tuna salad into the bell peppers.
Serve with a balsamic vinaigrette, if desired.
Enjoy!
