Preheat the oven to 450ºF (230ºC).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and soy milk, and whisk until smooth.
Add the cauliflower florets to the batter and toss until fully coated.
Transfer the coated cauliflower to the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, or until the coating looks dry.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over high heat, combine the soy sauce, agave, sesame oil, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and cornstarch, and stir until the mixture comes to a boil.
Turn off the heat and let sit for 10 minutes to thicken.
Remove the cauliflower from the oven and transfer to a large bowl to cool for 5 minutes.
Leave the oven on.
Add the sauce to the bowl and toss the cauliflower until completely coated, then return to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for another 10 minutes.
Top the cauliflower with chives and sesame seeds, and serve over rice, if desired.
Enjoy!
