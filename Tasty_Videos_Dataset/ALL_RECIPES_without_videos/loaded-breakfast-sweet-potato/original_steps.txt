Using a fork, poke holes on the top of the sweet potato.
Microwave on high for 10 minutes, or until the potato can be easily pierced with a knife.
Gently slice the sweet potato in half, lengthwise, and spread almond butter on each side. Top with banana slices, almonds, and blueberries, and drizzle with honey.
Enjoy!
