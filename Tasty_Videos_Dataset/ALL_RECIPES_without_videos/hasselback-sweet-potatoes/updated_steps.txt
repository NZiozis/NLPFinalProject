Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Make a series of slices across the sweet potatoes from tip to tip about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick.
Transfer to a greased baking dish.
Brush potatoes with olive oil.
Season with salt and pepper.
Bake for 1 hour, or until sweet potatoes are soft.
Dress one potato with maple syrup, pecans, rosemary, and cinnamon.
To one of the remaining potatoes, place thin slices of cheddar in between the potato slices and sprinkle with bacon.
To one of the remaining potatoes, dress with garlic, thyme, parsley, and Parmesan.
Place potatoes back in the oven for 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
While potatoes are cooking, combine yogurt, chipotle, lime, water, garlic, and salt into a small bowl.
Set aside.
Dress the last potato with avocado slices and the chipotle aioli.
Garnish the potatoes to your liking.
Enjoy!
