Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
On a cutting board, grate the zucchini, sweet potato, carrot, and broccoli with a coarse cheese grater.
Transfer the grated vegetables to a medium bowl and season with ½ teaspoon of salt. Mix until well incorporated.
Let the vegetables sit for 20 minutes until the salt has drawn out some of the moisture.
Transfer the grated veggies into a kitchen towel and twist to strain as much liquid as you can.
Place the grated veggies back into a bowl and mix with the Parmesan, panko, pepper, remaining salt, onion powder, garlic powder, olive oil, and egg. Mix until well combined.
Form the mixture into 20-25 even-sized tots and transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20-30 minutes or until tots are golden brown, flipping each halfway through.
Serve with your choice of dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
