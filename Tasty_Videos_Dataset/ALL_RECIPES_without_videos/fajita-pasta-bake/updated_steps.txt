Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a nonstick baking dish, add the bell peppers, mushrooms, and onion.
In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.
Pour the olive oil and half of the spice mix over the vegetables and toss well to coat.
Bake the vegetables for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender.
In a large pot of boiling water, cook the pasta according to the package instructions, until tender.
Drain the pasta, reserving about 1 cup (240 ml) of cooking water.
Return the drained pasta to the pot and add the roasted vegetables.
Add the rest of the spice mix, the reserved pasta water, and the sour cream and mix to combine.
Transfer the pasta mixture to the baking dish used for roasting the vegetables and spread evenly.
Sprinkle the cheese over the top.
Bake for about 15 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown.
Let cool for about 5 minutes, then serve.
Garnish with parsley, if desired.
Enjoy!
