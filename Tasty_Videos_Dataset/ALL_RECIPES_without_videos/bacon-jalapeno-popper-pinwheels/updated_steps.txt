Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) and cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
In a pan, cook bacon until crisp, then chop into small pieces.
Discard excess fat (reserve approximately 2 tablespoons).
In the same pan, sauté the onions in the reserved fat until they start to become translucent.
Add the jalapeños.
Cook until the onions start to caramelize and remove from heat.
In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, bacon, cheddar, pepper, garlic powder, and jalapeño mixture.
Stir until thoroughly incorporated.
On a lightly floured surface, gently roll out the puff pastry until the surface is smooth and even.
Spread the japapeño mixture on the pastry sheet, stopping 1 inch (2 ½ cm) from the top of the dough.
Starting at the bottom, tightly roll upwards and pinch the top edge to seal into a log shape.
Cut the roll every 1½ inches (3 ¾ cm).
Place the pieces face-up, 2 inches (5 cm) apart on the baking sheet.
Sprinkle the tops of the pastries with cheddar.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the sides of the pastries are a light golden color.
Enjoy!
