Mash bananas in a large bowl until smooth.
Mix in eggs and vanilla until well combined, then mix in oats and cinnamon.
Heat a skillet to medium and add in a scoop* of the pancake batter.
Smooth out to form an even layer.
Cook for about 2-3 minutes until you start to see bubbles releasing from the top of the batter.
Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.
Garnish your pancakes with your favorite toppings! We used banana slices, chopped walnuts & maple syrup.
Enjoy!
*Note: Use ½ cup for scooping the batter to yield 4 thicker pancakes; Use ⅓ cup to yield 6 smaller pancakes.
