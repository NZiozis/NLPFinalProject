Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix until thoroughly combined.
Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Use a spoon or tablespoon to evenly divide the mixture into 6 balls. Use your hands to form the ball.
Enjoy one now and save the rest for later by storing them in a sealed container in the refrigerator up to 1 week.
Enjoy!
