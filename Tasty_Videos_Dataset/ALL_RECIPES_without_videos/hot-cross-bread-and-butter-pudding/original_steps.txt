Cut the hot cross buns in half and butter both sides. Sprinkle in half of the chocolate chips across all six buns and close.
Place in a tin that gives them a snug fit.
Whisk together the milk, egg and sugar in another bowl and pour over the buns. Sprinkle over the other half of the chocolate chips.
Bake for 30 mins at 300°F convection (150°C Fan).
Enjoy!
