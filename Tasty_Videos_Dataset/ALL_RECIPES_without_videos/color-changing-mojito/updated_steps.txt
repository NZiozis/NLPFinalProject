Add water and red cabbage to a medium-size pot.
Bring the water to a boil, then strain the cabbage in a sieve over a bowl to reserve the blue liquid.
Pour the strained blue water into an ice tray.
You will be left with 1 cup (235 ml) of blue water.
Reserve the water and freeze the ice tray for 6 hours, or overnight.
Add the reserved blue water to a pot with the sugar and bring to a boil until the sugar has dissolved.
Set aside.
Combine the lime juice with 1Â½ (355 ml) cups of water and stir to combine.
Pour the lime mixture into an ice tray and freeze for 6 hours, up to overnight.
Add the blue ice cubes to a blender and blend until finely crushed.
Put the crushed blue ice in a glass.
Wash the blender well.
Add the lime ice cubes and 8 mint leaves.
Blend until finely crushed.
Put the crushed lime and mint ice on top of the blue ice.
Slowly pour the white rum and blue simple syrup.
Top with a sprig of mint.
Enjoy!
