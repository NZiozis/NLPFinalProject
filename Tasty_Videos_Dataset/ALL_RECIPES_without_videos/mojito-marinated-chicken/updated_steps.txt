Slice the chicken breasts in half lengthways.
Put all of the ingredients into a ziplock bag and stir them all about so everything is coated and mixed up.
Marinate for at least 4 hours, but try to leave them over night if you have the time.
Cook the chicken as you usually would, we used a griddle pan on a medium heat for about 6-7 minutes on each side, but these can go in a regular pan, the oven or even on the BBQ!
Donâ€™t forget to give it one last squeeze of lemon juice to give it that extra kick!
Enjoy!
