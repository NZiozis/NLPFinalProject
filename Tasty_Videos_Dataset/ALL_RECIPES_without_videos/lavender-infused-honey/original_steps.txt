Pour the honey into a medium, heavy saucepan and place over medium heat. Be sure to use a large enough pot because the honey can easily boil over.
Add in the dried lavender and let the honey come to a boil.
Let the honey boil for about 5 minutes to let the lavender infuse, then remove from the heat.
Pour the honey through a mesh sieve into a heat-proof container.
Allow the honey to cool, uncovered, until room temperature, at least 1 hour.
Enjoy!
