In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk the yolks and sugar until pale in color.
Add cornstarch and whisk well. Add the vanilla extract and milk. Whisk until well combined.
Loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 4 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove plastic and stir.
Cover with a plastic wrap and chill at least 30 minutes.
Cut the thawed puff pastry into three equal-sized rectangles.
Pierce each piece of puff pastry with a fork.
Heat a nonstick pan over low heat. Place the puff pastry in the pan and cook for 10 minutes.
Flip the puff pastry sheets, and place a lid on the top of the pan. Cook for 10 minutes.
Remove the lid and sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on sheet of puff pastry. Flip the pastry over so that the sugared side is on the bottom.
Bring the heat up to high. Place a piece of parchment paper over the puff pastry and weigh it down with another pan. Once the surface is caramelized, about 1-2 minutes, remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature on a cooling rack.
Place the custard in a piping bag fitting with an large round tip.
Pipe the custard on one sheet of puff pastry. Top with a layer of sliced strawberries, then pipe another row of custard. Top with another sheet of puff pastry, custard, sliced strawberries, custard, and the remaining puff pastry sheet.
Dust the top with powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
