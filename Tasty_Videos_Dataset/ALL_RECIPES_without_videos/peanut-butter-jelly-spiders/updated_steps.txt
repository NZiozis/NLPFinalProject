Using the lid of a wide mouth mason jar, carve out rounds into both slices of bread, remove the crusts.
Spread peanut butter evenly across one side of one of the rounds and spread jelly evenly across one side of the other round.
Place peanut butter round and jelly round together to create the “body” of the spider.
Place 4 pretzel sticks into the left side of the sandwich and 4 pretzel sticks into the right side, creating the “spider legs.”
Place raisins on the sandwich to create the “eyes.”
Enjoy!
