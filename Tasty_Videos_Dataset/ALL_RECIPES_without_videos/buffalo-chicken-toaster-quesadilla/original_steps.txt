Using a butter knife, spread the cream cheese in an even layer over the tortilla.
In a small bowl, mix together the chicken and buffalo sauce.
Add the chicken to the top half of the tortilla. Sprinkle with scallions.
Fold the tortilla in half from the bottom, then fold in the sides, being careful not to tear the tortilla.
Toast on medium-high, until golden brown. Watch to make sure it doesnâ€™t burn. Let cool for 1-2 minutes before removing from the toaster.
Serve with ranch, if desired.
Enjoy!
