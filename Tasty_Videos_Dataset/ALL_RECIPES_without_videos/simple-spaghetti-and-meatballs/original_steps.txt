Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Add the crushed tomatoes, butter, onion, and salt to a pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Lower the heat and cook for 45 minutes, until the onions are soft and starting to break apart. Remove onion.
In a bowl, mix the ground beef, ground pork, panko, Parmesan, egg, garlic, onion, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, and parsley until fully combined.
Take a golf ball-sized handful of the meat mixture and roll it into a ball. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining meat.
Bake the meatballs for 16 minutes.
Bring a pot of water to a boil, and cook the spaghetti according to the packaging instructions.
Drain pasta and toss lightly in about a tablespoon of oil (optional).
Pour the sauce over the pasta. Transfer the cooked meatballs and top with Parmesan.
Enjoy!
