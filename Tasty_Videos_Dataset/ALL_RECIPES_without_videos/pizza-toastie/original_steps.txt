Top one piece of bread with marinara sauce, mozzarella cheese, and pepperoni.
Cover with a second piece of bread and butter both slices of bread from edge to edge.
Place in preheated toastie machine and cook until bread is golden brown. (If the toastie is not browning evenly, flip half way through).
Remove from toastie and slice in half.
Enjoy!
