Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth.
Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and cinnamon.
Pour the graham cracker crumbs evenly over the prepared baking sheet.
Pipe the cream cheese mixture into 8 “chicken” nuggets directly onto the graham cracker crumbs.
Use a spoon to gently cover the nuggets completely with the crumbs, then cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours.
In a small bowl, combine the raspberry preserves and chocolate syrup to make “barbecue sauce”.
Gently brush any excess crumbs off the nuggets, then serve with the sauce.
Enjoy!
