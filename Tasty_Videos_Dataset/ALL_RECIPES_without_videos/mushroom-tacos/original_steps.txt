Add mushrooms to food processor and pulse until a crumbly consistency is formed, making sure not to over-pulse.
Heat olive oil in pan over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is translucent.
Add the mushrooms and saute for 8-10 minutes, or until most water has evaporated.
Add soy sauce, cumin, chili powder and pepper. Sauté for 5 more minutes, or until desired consistency is reached.
Serve on warm tortillas with desired taco toppings.
Enjoy!
