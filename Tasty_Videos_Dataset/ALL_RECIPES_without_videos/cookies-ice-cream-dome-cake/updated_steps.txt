Separate the cream and cookies from 15 chocolate sandwich cookies into 2 medium bowls.
Place the cookie halves in a zip-top bag and crush with a rolling pin until fine crumbs form.
Melt the cookie cream in the microwave for 30 seconds, or until melted.
In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream and vanilla until thickened and soft peaks form.
Add the sweetened condensed milk, melted cookie cream, and cookie crumbs.
Fold with a spatula until combined.
Line a separate large bowl with the remaining sandwich cookies.
Pour in the cream mixture and smooth the top to cover.
Cover and freeze overnight, or until solid.
Invert onto a serving plate, allowing the ice cream dome to release from the bowl.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
