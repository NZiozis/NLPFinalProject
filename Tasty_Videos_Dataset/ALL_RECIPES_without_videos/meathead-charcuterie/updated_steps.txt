Cover a plastic skull with plastic food wrap.
Use thin slices of prosciutto to cover the plastic skull.
Leave the eye sockets, nose hole and teeth uncovered.
Carefully make an incision on the plastic around the eye sockets.
Insert pickled olives in the sockets to create the eyes.
Place the meathead on a platter and add cheese and crackers.
Enjoy!
