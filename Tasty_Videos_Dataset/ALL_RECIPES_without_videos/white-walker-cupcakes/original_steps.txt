Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Arrange the hard candies on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 3-4 minutes, or until melted and fused together in a thin layer. Let cool.
Once cool to the touch, drop the baking sheet onto a flat surface to break the candy, then separate into large chunks.
Add the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a round tip, then pipe onto the cupcakes. Sprinkle coconut flakes over the frosting. Top with the broken candy pieces.
Enjoy!
