Pour soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, brown sugar, water, and cornstarch over the strips of beef.
Mix well, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
In a wok or deep skillet, cook the beef in the marinade thoroughly and set aside.
In the same pan, heat up the oil and cook onions, garlic, and broccoli until onions are translucent.
Push all of the cooked vegetables to the side of the pan.
Beat the eggs and pour into the cleared half of the pan.
Scramble the eggs and mix with the rest of the vegetables.
Add rice, soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper, and cooked beef.
Mix well and let the rice cook until slightly crispy.
Enjoy!
