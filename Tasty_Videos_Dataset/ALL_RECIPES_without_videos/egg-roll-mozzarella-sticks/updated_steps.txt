Slice the egg roll wrappers in half.
Place a stick of string cheese on the edge of the egg roll wrapper, then fold the sides of the wrapper over the ends of the cheese.
Wet the other edge of the wrapper with water, then roll it up tightly, pressing the edge to make sure itâ€™s sealed.
Repeat with the remaining wrappers and cheese.
Heat oil in a pot.
Fry the sticks until golden brown, then drain on a paper towel.
Serve with marinara.
Enjoy!
