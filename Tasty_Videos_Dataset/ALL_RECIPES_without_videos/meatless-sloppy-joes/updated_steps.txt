In a medium skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, until semi-translucent.
Add the bell pepper and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the onion is translucent.
Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, and salt and cook 2-3 minutes more, until the garlic is soft and fragrant.
Season with salt.
Add the textured vegetable protein, vegetable broth, and tomato sauce and stir well until combined.
Cover and cook for 15 minutes, until most of the liquid has been absorbed.
Remove the lid and add the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and yellow mustard.
Mix to combine and cook for 3-4 more minutes, until the remaining liquid has been absorbed.
Serve on hamburger buns.
Enjoy!
