Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C).
Place the sugar cookie dough sheet on a lightly floured surface.
Sprinkle the flour over the dough and knead together.
Roll out the dough to a ¼-inch (6-mm) thick square.
Top with sprinkles and lightly roll out the dough again so the sprinkles become submerged in the dough.
Place a spoon on top of the dough and trace its shape with a paring knife.
Reroll the dough as needed to cut out 8 spoons.
Arrange spoons upside-down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Lightly grease with nonstick cooking spray.
Place each cookie spoon cutout on top of a spoon.
Lightly press down to mold.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cookie dough is light brown.
Cool for 10 minutes before carefully removing the cookies from the spoons.
Microwave the milk chocolate chips and coconut oil together in a glass measuring cup or bowl in 30-second intervals, until the chips are completely melted.
Dip each cookie spoon in chocolate and let dry on a wire rack for about 10 minutes.
Serve with ice cream, if desired.
Enjoy!
