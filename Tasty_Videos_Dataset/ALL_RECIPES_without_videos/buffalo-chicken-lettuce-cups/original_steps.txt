Place chicken breasts, 2 teaspoons of salt, peppercorns, onion quarters, garlic cloves, bay leaves, and water in a large pot.
Cover the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Once the water is simmering, cook for 10 minutes, until the chicken registers 165°F (74°C) when pierced with an instant-read thermometer.
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and reserve at least ½ cup (120 ml) of the cooking liquid to use as chicken broth . Using 2 forks, pull the chicken apart until shredded.
In a large nonstick pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
Add the diced onion, diced celery, and a pinch of salt. Sauté until the vegetables have softened, about 2 minutes.
Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the hot sauce and chicken broth. Stir until the liquid has reduced slightly, about 5 minutes.
Add the shredded chicken and mix until everything is well incorporated.
Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool for 5 minutes before spooning into the lettuce leaves.
Top with shredded carrots, sliced celery, and bleu cheese dressing.
Enjoy!
