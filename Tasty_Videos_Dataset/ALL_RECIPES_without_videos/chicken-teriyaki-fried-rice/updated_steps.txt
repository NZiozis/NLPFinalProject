Marinate the chicken in teriyaki sauce in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
In a wok or deep skillet, add the chicken in the teriyaki marinade and cook thoroughly over high heat.
Set aside.
In the same pan, add the oil and cook onions, garlic, and carrots until onions are translucent.
Add broccoli and cook an additional 3-4 minutes.
Push all of the cooked vegetables to the side of the pan.
Beat the eggs and pour into the cleared half of the pan.
Scramble the eggs and mix with the rest of the vegetables.
Add rice, cooked chicken, soy sauce, sesame oil, and pepper.
Mix well and let the rice cook until slightly crispy.
Enjoy!
