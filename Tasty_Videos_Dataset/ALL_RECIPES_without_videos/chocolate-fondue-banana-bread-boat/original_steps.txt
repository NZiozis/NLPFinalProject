Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork.
Add in the oil, egg, sugar, and vanilla. Stir until combined.
Add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir until just combined.
Pour the banana bread batter into a greased loaf pan.
Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
In a small saucepan, combine the cream milk and chocolate, and melt over low heat.
Add the vanilla and stir to combine. Remove from heat, and cover with a lid.
Let the banana bread cool in the pan for 30 minutes, then remove from the loaf pan and place on a serving dish.
Using a knife cut a rectangle out of the top center of the loaf, leaving a 2- to 3-inch (5 cm to 7cm) perimeter of banana bread, making sure to not slice through the bread. Cut the rectangle into 2-inch (5-cm) slices. Gently pull out each slice one at a time. Press the crumbs into the base of the cut out bread.
Reheat the chocolate if needed then pour the chocolate into the banana bread boat.
Place sliced bananas, strawberries, and the inside of the banana bread around the fondue boat.
Enjoy!
