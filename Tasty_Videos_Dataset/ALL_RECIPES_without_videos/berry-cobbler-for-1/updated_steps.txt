In a medium bowl, add the flour, baking powder, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and the butter.
Cut the butter into the flour with a fork until the mixture crumbly.
Add the milk and stir until the mixture comes together.
Heat the mini frying pan over low heat.
Add the berries, water, and remaining tablespoon of sugar to the frying pan.
Scoop the dough on top of the berries, flatten slightly with a spoon, and cover with a small plate.
Cook for 30 minutes or until the berries have softened and the dough is cooked through.
Enjoy!
