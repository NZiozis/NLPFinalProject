Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.
Preheat the oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a medium bowl, toss together the vegetable peels, olive oil, and salt.
Spread the peels in an even layer on a baking sheet.
Roast for 20-25 minutes, tossing halfway through, until the peels are dried and crisp, but not burnt.
In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, paprika, and dried parsley.
Toss the peel chips with the spice mixture.
Season with salt to taste.
The veggie peel chips will keep for up to 3 days stored in a cool, dry place.
Enjoy!
