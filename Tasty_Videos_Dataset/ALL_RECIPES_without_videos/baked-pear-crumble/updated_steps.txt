Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a food processor, combine the oats, hazelnuts, walnuts, shredded coconut, cherries, flax seeds, cinnamon, and salt.
Pulse until finely ground.
Add the coconut oil, honey, and vanilla, and pulse until just combined.
The mixture should hold together when squeezed between your fingers.
Cut the pears in half lengthwise.
Using a tablespoon, scoop out the cores.
With a paring knife, cut a “v” shape around the edges of the stem, cutting downward on an angle.
Remove the stems.
Set the pears in a baking dish, cut-side up.
Fill each with ¼ cup (30 grams) of the crumble topping, pressing lightly into the pears.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the pears are tender when pierced with a paring knife.
Serve immediately, topped with whipped topping and a drizzle of honey, if desired.
Enjoy!
