Add garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, sesame oil, rice vinegar, olive oil, and coconut aminos into a mason jar and secure lid tightly.
Shake vigorously until ingredients are mixed thoroughly.
Store dressing in the fridge and use within 1-2 weeks. You may need to shake up the ingredients again before each use.
Enjoy!
