Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Add the bread cubes to a medium bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon black pepper until well coated.
Spread the bread cubes in an even layer on a baking sheet.
Toast for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, whisk together the shallot, garlic, mustard, vinegar, remaining teaspoon of pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt.
Slowly drizzle in ¼ cup olive oil, whisking constantly, until the dressing is emulsified.
Set aside.
Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.
Once the oil is shimmering, add the corn and cook, stirring, until charred in spots, about 5 minutes.
Season with the remaining ½ teaspoon salt.
Transfer the corn to a large bowl and add the toasted bread cubes, tomatoes, mozzarella, and dressing.
Toss well.
Add the basil and toss again to incorporate.
Enjoy!
