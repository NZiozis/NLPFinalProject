Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
Lay out 12 mason jar lid rings upside down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Spray rings thoroughly with cooking spray.
Mix cans of beans, BBQ sauce, seasoned salt, egg, and panko in food processor until it becomes a thick paste.
Mix cornbread batter/mix - it should be fairly thick
Fill 4 rings with bean mix (they can be compacted to the rim of the ring).
Fill 8 rings with cornbread batter.
(Do not completely fill.
Leave a small amount of room at the top to allow for rise, making sure the spread batter evenly throughout ring.)
Bake 20-25 minutes or until cornbread is golden brown and burgers are lightly browned.
Mix all ingredients for the spicy mayo and store in a refrigerator until ready to use.
Assemble burger including any additional ingredients desired (we used sautéed kale, but also suggest collard greens or spinach).
Enjoy!
