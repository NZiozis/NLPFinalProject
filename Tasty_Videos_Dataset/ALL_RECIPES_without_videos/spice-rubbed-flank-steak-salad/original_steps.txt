Season both sides of the flank steak generously with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne. Massage the spices into the steak well.
In an oiled skillet, cook steak for 2-3 minutes on both sides (depending on desired doneness), flipping once.
Remove steak from skillet and allow to rest on a cutting board for 10 minutes. Allowing the steak to rest before cutting it allows the juices to resettle.
While the steak rests, combine the mustard, honey, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Whisk to combine. Set aside.
Cut the steak against the grain.
Assemble the salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, avocados, shredded carrots, and red onion. Top with cut steak.
Serve with dressing.
Enjoy!
