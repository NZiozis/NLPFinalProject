Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
In a large pan or skillet, lay down half of the tortilla chips, followed by half of the ground beef, bbq sauce, cheddar, mozzarella, tomato, red onion, bacon, and parsley.
Repeat with the remaining half of the ingredients, followed by a drizzle of BBQ sauce on top.
Bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is melted.
Enjoy!
