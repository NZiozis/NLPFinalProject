Add the onion, garlic, jalape√±o, chipotle peppers, cilantro, and tomatoes to a food processor.
Puree until well combined, with no large pieces remaining, about 2 minutes.
Set aside.
Season the chicken thighs on both sides with salt and the oregano.
In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.
Sear the chicken thighs for 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
Transfer to a cutting board.
Shred the chicken using 2 forks.
Set aside.
Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the same pot if it appears dry.
Pour the reserved puree into the pot.
Cook over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, until the liquid has started to evaporate.
Reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until nearly all the moisture has been cooked out and the puree has reduced to a dark paste, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, about 20 minutes.
Pour in the chicken stock and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan to incorporate any browned bits.
Increase the heat to medium-high.
Stir in the shredded chicken and bring to a simmer.
Once the stock is simmering, stir in the hominy and bell pepper.
Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
Add the lime juice and season with salt to taste.
Serve the soup hot, with onion, cilantro, avocado, cotija cheese, tortilla strips, and lime wedges alongside for topping.
Enjoy!
