In a blender, blend the egg, milk, oats, baking powder, and Greek yogurt.
In a squirt bottle, combine cinnamon, brown sugar, and coconut oil.
On a griddle or pan over medium-high heat, pour pancake batter in Â¼ cup (60 ml) amounts.
Drizzle cinnamon sugar mixture over the pancake.
When bubbles start to pop on the surface, flip and cook completely.
Enjoy!
