Combine dates, almonds, almond butter, salt, and half of the coconut in a food processor and blend until a sticky dough forms. (If dough is not coming together, add one tablespoon of water and continue blending.)
Wet your hands and form dough into 2 tablespoon-sized ball. Roll in remaining shredded coconut.
Let dry at room temperature for 2 hours before serving. Store in an airtight container.
Enjoy!
