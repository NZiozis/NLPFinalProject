In a saucepan over medium heat, add the quartered strawberries, water, and sugar. Stir until combined and bring to a boil.
Turn down the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. If the syrup is too thin, mix together the cornstarch and water and add it to the strawberries. Stir again and cook until thickened about 5 minutes. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the wet ingredients.
In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients.
Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry and gently mix until just incorporated. Do not over-mix!
Heat 1 tablespoon of butter on a skillet over medium heat.
Add Â½ cup (145 g) of batter to the skillet and cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake. Flip and set aside.
Stack the pancakes and top with strawberry syrup and a dollop of whipped cream.
Enjoy!
