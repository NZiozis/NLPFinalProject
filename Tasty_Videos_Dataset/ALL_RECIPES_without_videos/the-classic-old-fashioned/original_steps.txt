Place sugar in the bottom of a rocks glass. Add bitters and muddle together until combined.
Add preferred amount of ice and pour over whiskey. Stir until sugar is mostly dissolved.
Hold a piece of orange peel between your thumb and forefinger and squeeze over the glass to release the oil. If you like, you can carefully use a match or lighter to flame the orange oils for a caramelized flavor.
Garnish with the orange peel and a single cherry.
Enjoy!
