Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Remove the kale leaves from the thick stems, and tear into bite-size pieces.
In a medium bowl, top kale with olive oil.
Mix seasonings and add to the kale.
Toss until fully coated.
Arrange seasoned kale on a baking sheet.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the edges are brown, but not burnt.
Allow to cool to room temperature.
Enjoy!
