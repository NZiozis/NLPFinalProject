Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick spray.
Trim the ends from the zucchini, then slice lengthwise with a vegetable peeler.
Line the muffin cups with the zucchini strips on the bottom and sides.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, feta, spinach, mushrooms, milk, salt, and pepper.
Divide the egg mixture evenly among the zucchini cups, using a spoon to distribute the mushrooms.
Bake for 18 minutes, until the edges are slightly browned.
Enjoy!
