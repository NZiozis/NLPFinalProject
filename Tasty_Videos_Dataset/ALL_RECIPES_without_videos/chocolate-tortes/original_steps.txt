In a small bowl, combine the chocolate biscuit crumbs with the butter and sugar.
Spoon into a mini cupcake tray and freeze for 10 minutes, until set.
Pour the hot double cream and chocolate spread over the chocolate and allow the heat of the cream to melt the chocolate. Whisk to combine.
Pour the ganache over the biscuit bases.
Chill in the fridge for 1 hour, until set.
Garnish with raspberries and a sprig of mint.
Enjoy!
