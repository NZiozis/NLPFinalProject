Sprinkle gelatin over the water. The gelatin will absorb the water and dissolve, in a process called “blooming.”
In a small saucepan, combine heavy cream with sugar and cook over medium until it’s at the scalding point, or just under a boil.
Once the cream has almost reached the boiling point, remove from heat and add vanilla extract and bloomed gelatin. Stir until fully dissolved.
Strain panna cotta mixture into desired serving tempered glasses.
Allow cream to come to room temperature before chilling in the fridge for 2-4 hours, or until the cream is firm in texture.
Top with berries and honey.
Enjoy!
