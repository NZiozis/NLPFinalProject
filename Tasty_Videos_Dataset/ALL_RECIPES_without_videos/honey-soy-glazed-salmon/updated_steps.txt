Place salmon in a sealable bag or medium bowl.
In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix marinade ingredients.
Pour half of the marinade on the salmon.
Save the other half for later.
Let the salmon marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
In a medium pan, heat oil.
Add salmon to the pan, but discard the used marinade.
Cook salmon on one side for about 2-3 minutes, then flip over and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
Remove salmon from pan.
Pour in remaining marinade and reduce.
Serve the salmon with sauce and a side of veggies.
We used broccoli.
Enjoy!
