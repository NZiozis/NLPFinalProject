Thoroughly mix all the meatball ingredients, and shape them into golf ball-sized balls.
Over low to medium heat, fry all sides of the meatballs, until the meatballs are cooked through and the outsides are golden brown.
It will take around 12-15 minutes.
If you are making a large quantity for a party, make the meatballs in advance and reheat them in an oven for 10-15 minutes at 175Â°C.
(When reheating, ensure the meatballs are piping hot throughout before serving.)
To make the cream sauce, dissolve a beef stock cube in 20 milliliters of water.
Then add in cream, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.
Toss the meatballs in the sauce while it reduces to a thick and creamy sauce.
Serve the meatballs in soft French sticks with sliced cucumber and lingonberry or cranberry jam.
Enjoy!
