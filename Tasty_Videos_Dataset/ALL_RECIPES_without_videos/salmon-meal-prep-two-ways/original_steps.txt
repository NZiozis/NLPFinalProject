In a square baking dish, combine the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, oil, and garlic, and whisk to combine.
Put 2 of the salmon fillets in the soy and balsamic mixture, making sure all sides are coated.
Transfer to the refrigerator, marinading for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
In a small bowl, mix together the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
Evenly coat the remaining 2 salmon filets with the spice rub.
Place the salmon and vegetables on a parchment paper-lined baking tray.
Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper to taste over the vegetables.
Bake for 11 minutes per inch (2 ½ cm) of salmon thickness.
Divide the salmon and vegetables into 4 containers, mix and matching the vegetables to your liking.
Refrigerate for up to 3 days.
Enjoy!
