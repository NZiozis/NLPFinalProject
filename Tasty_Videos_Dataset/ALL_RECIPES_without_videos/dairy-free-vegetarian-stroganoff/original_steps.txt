Break the jackfruit into smaller pieces, discarding the core and any seeds. Place in a bowl and set aside.
Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, until softened.
Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Add the mushrooms and jackfruit and cook for 5-8 minutes, until softened.
Add the vegetable broth, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and bring to a boil.
Add the arrowroot powder to the dairy-free milk and stir until dissolved. Add the mixture to the boiling stroganoff. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally.
Serve the stroganoff over egg noodles and garnish with chives.
Enjoy!
