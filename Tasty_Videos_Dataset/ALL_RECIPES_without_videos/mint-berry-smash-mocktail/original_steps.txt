In a cocktail shaker, or a tall glass, muddle raspberries, blueberries, and mint.
Add lime juice, sweetener, and ice, and shake until well combined. If you do not have a cocktail shaker, simply pour back and forth between two glasses until combined.
Strain mixture over ice and top with a splash of soda water.
Garnish with berries and mint.
Enjoy!
