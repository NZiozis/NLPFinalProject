Stir together rolled oats, grated carrot, raisins, and ½ of the almond milk.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge overnight.
(If you’re following the Clean Eating Challenge, you already did this!)
Combine the carrot-oat mixture, the remaining ½ of the almond milk, honey, vanilla, and cinnamon in a small pot over medium heat.
Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thick and the oats are cooked, 4 to 5 minutes.
Serve immediately, with almonds and Greek yogurt on top.
Enjoy!
