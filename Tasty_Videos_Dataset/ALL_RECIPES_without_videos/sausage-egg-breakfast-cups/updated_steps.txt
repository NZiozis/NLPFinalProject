Mix sausage, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and dried parsley in a bowl until well combined.
Grease a muffin tin and start to form shells with the sausage mix.
Cover the sides and leave room in the middle for the eggs.
In a separate bowl, mix the eggs, salt, and pepper.
Pour egg mixture into the middle of each cup.
Top with shredded cheese, tomatoes, spinach, or toppings of your choice.
Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 30 minutes.
Enjoy!
