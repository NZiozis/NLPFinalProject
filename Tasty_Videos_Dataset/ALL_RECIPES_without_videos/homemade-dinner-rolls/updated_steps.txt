Combine warm milk (110-115˚F or 45˚C), butter, warm water (110-115˚F or 45˚C), and sugar in a large bowl and stir until mixed.
Sprinkle yeast evenly over the top of the mixture and let sit for 1 minute.
Add the salt, egg, and 4 cups (500g) of flour.
Mix until the mixture just comes together and forms a dough.
Cover for 30 minutes with a towel or plastic wrap.
Uncover, and mix in the rest of the flour and turn out onto a well-floured surface.
Knead until dough until it forms a smooth ball and loses some of its stickiness.
Cover for 30 additional minutes with a towel or plastic wrap.
Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Uncover, and roll dough into 16 equally sized balls, roughly the size of a tangerine.
