Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
Place the apple peels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Mix the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle it over the peels.
Toss the peels with your hands until evenly coated with the sugar mixture.
Bake for about 30 minutes, tossing the peels halfway through with a pair of tongs.
Let cool before eating.
Enjoy!
