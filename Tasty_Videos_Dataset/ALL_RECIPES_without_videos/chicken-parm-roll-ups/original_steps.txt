Lightly season the chicken breast with salt and pepper, then slice it into strips about ½ inch (1.5 cm) in thickness.
Dredge each piece of chicken in flour followed by egg and bread crumbs.
Quickly fry chicken strips in ½ inch (1.5 cm) of oil over medium heat, cooking for about 30 seconds each side to color the breading. Set cooked strips aside to drain on paper towels. (NOTE: The chicken will NOT be fully cooked after this stage.)
On a clean surface, assemble the roll-ups. Start by laying a cooked lasagna noodle flat. Using a spoon, spread marinara sauce on one end of the noodle. Next, add a slice of mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce followed by a piece of chicken. Starting from the end with the sauce on it, roll up the noodle like a sleeping bag towards the un-sauced side.
Place each roll-up into a large casserole dish that has been lightly covered with nonstick cooking spray.
Pour remaining sauce over roll-ups, then generously cover with mozzarella cheese.
Bake at 350˚F (180˚C) for 20 minutes until cheese is melted and edges of lasagna noodle are slightly crisped.
Serve and garnish with parsley.
Enjoy!
