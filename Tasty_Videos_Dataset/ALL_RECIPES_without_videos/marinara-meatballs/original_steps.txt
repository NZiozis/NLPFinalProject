Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
In a medium-size bowl mix together the beef, pork, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, garlic, eggs, salt, and pepper until just combined.
Take a walnut size of the meat mixture and roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining meat and transfer to an oiled rack on a sheet tray.
Bake meatballs for 15 minutes, until golden brown. Set aside.
Add a little oil to a pan on medium-high heat and cook the onions and garlic until they are deeply caramelized.
Add in the oregano, parsley, basil, red pepper flakes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce.
Stir the mixture and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes.
Add the meatballs and coat them with the sauce.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, poke with toothpicks, and serve!
Enjoy!
