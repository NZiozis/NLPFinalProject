Place the quinoa in a medium bowl. Add enough water to cover the quinoa, about 1½ cups (360 ml).
Cover with plastic wrap and soak, at room temperature, for at least 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease it with nonstick cooking spray.
Drain and rinse the quinoa.
Add the quinoa, 1 cup (240 ml) of water, the baking powder, garlic powder, salt, and Parmesan cheese to a food processor. Blend for about 2 minutes, or until a smooth batter forms.
Pour the batter onto the baking sheet, using a spatula to spread evenly.
Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Flip the crust, removing the parchment paper, and bake for 10 minutes more, or until golden brown.
Top the crust with the pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese, then add your favorite toppings.
Return the pizza to the oven and bake for another 5-10 minutes, or until cheese bubbling and slightly brown.
Cut pizza into squares and serve.
Enjoy!
