Combine all marinade ingredients with the chicken breast and leave to marinade in the fridge for 20 minutes.
Coat the chicken breast first in flour, then eggs, and finally panko breadcrumbs.
In a medium-sized saucepan heat the oil to 170°C (325˚F).
Deep fry the breaded chicken for about 3-4 minutes until the coating is golden brown and the chicken is cooked through.
In a small frying pan, combine the chicken stock, orange zests, orange juice, and sugar, then stir.
Bring the mixture to a boil.
Mix the cornflour with the water, then add the mixture to the pan to thicken the sauce.
Add the chicken to the frying pan and coat with the orange sauce.
Serve on top of rice and add toppings of your choice.
Enjoy!
