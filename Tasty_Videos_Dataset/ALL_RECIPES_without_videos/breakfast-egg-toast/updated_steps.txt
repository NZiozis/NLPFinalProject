Cut the middle of the bread from the slice leaving a Â½-inch (1 cm) border of crust.
In a pan, place the tomato, ham, and green onion.
Cook over medium heat, stirring for about two minutes.
With a spatula or spoon arrange the toppings into the shape of the inside of the bread.
Place the crust over the toppings.
Carefully pour the egg into the hole on top of the toppings to make sure the egg does not spill over.
Season with salt and pepper and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese.
Place the inside of the bread back on top and once the eggs are cooked and cheese is melted flip over, about two more minutes.
Enjoy!
