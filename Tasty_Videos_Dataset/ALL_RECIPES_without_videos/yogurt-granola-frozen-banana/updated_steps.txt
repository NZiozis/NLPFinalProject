Peel bananas and cut in half.
Place popsicle sticks inside bananas and put on tray with parchment paper.
Freeze for 1 to 3 hours depending on how firm you want your bananas to be.
When bananas are ready, coat in yogurt and sprinkle with granola.
Set aside and freeze for an additional 20 minutes.
Enjoy!
