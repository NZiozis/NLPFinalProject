Tear up the two slices of bread and blend into soft breadcrumbs.
Add the breadcrumbs, grated potato, grated cheddar cheese, spring onions, egg and salt and pepper to a large bowl and mix until properly combined.
Add the marmite and a splash of water to a small bowl and microwave until slightly runny. Set aside.
Dust the surface with plan flour and roll out 500g (2 cups) of shortcrust pastry into a rectangular shape the thickness of a pound coin.
Use a 15-16cm (6 in) diameter bowl to cut out circles of the pastry.
Brush the marmite in a circle in the middle of the circle, leaving a 2-3cm (1 in) border around the edge. Add 2-3 tbsp of the potato filling on top.
Brush the border with egg wash and fold over into a semi circle shape, making sure it is sealed.
Crimp the sealed edges so that the filling is extra secure. Brush with more egg wash.
Re-roll any leftover pastry to make more!
Bake for around 50 mins at 150°C (300°F) until golden brown.
Enjoy!
