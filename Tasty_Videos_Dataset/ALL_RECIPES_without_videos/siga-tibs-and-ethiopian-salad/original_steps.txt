Make the Ethiopian salad: In a large bowl, combine the garlic, lemon juice, tomatoes, onion, and jalapeño. Season with salt, the olive oil, and pepper. Toss well.
Add the lettuce and toss again.
Make the siga tibs: Heat a large nonstick pan over high heat. Add the steak and season with salt. Cook until nicely browned, or 7-8 minutes.
Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the butter and let it melt, then add the jalapeño and sauté for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Remove the pan from the heat.
Serve the salad and siga tibs with injera bread and your desired accompaniments.
Enjoy!
