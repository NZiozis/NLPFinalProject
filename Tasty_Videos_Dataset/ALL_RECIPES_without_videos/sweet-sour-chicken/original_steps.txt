Season chicken with salt and pepper. Coat with cornstarch, dip in beaten egg.
Fry until golden, crispy and cooked through. Set aside. Dab with paper towel if greasy.
In a large pan, heat oil and fry garlic until fragrant.
Add the bell pepper, cider vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup and sugar. Bring to a boil.
When the sauce has thickened, add the fried chicken. Toss to coat.
Garnish with chopped scallions and sesame seeds. Serve with rice.
Enjoy!
