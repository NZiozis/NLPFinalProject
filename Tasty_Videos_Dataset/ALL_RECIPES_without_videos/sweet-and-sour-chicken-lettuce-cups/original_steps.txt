Place the chicken breasts, salt, peppercorns, halved onion, whole garlic cloves, bay leaves, and water in a large pot.
Cover the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Once the water is simmering, cook for 10 minutes, until the chicken registers 165°F (74°C) when pierced with an instant-read thermometer.
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and discard the cooking liquid. Using 2 forks, pull the chicken apart until shredded.
In a large nonstick pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
Add the diced onion and a pinch of salt and sauté until softened, about 2 minutes.
Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the soy sauce, honey, and lime juice and stir until the mixture has thickened slightly, about 2 minutes.
Add the shredded chicken and mix until everything is well incorporated.
Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool for 5 minutes before spooning into the lettuce leaves.
Top with sliced scallions.
Enjoy!
