Preheat oven to 425째F (215째C).
In a medium bowl, combine the panko, parmesan cheese, basil, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper.
Beat the 2 eggs in a shallow dish.
Dredge the chicken in the egg wash, then coat with the bread crumb mixture.
Transfer the breaded chicken breasts to a greased roasting pan.
Top the chicken with 2 small slices of mozzarella.
Bake for 20-25 min, until the cheese and bread crumbs have turned golden brown and the chicken is cooked through, or until it has reached an internal temperature of 165째F (73째C).
Serve with whole wheat spaghetti, marinara sauce, and a sprinkle of fresh basil.
Enjoy!
