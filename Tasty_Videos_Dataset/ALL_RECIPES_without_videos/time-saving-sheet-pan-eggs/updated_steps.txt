Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until smooth.
Pour the eggs onto a greased sheet pan and sprinkle in your favorite toppings.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the eggs are cooked through.
Slice the omelette and serve immediately or put into a storage container and freeze for up to 1 month.
Enjoy!
