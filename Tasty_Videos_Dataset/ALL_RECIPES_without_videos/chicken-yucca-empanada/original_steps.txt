Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the tomato, scallions, onion, garlic, and salt, and cook, stirring occasionally.
Add the chicken, and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is warmed through.
For the dough, mash the cooked yucca with a fork in a large bowl.
Roll a 4-inch (10-cm) ball of yucca and place in the center of a piece of plastic wrap. Add another piece of plastic wrap over the dough and flatten to create a small circle. Roll out to a 6-inch (15-cm) round.
Scoop 3 tablespoons of the chicken mixture onto the dough and add a couple of pieces of mozzarella over the chicken mixture. Fold over the dough to form an empanada and seal the edges. Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling.
Heat 2 inches (5 cm) of oil in a large pan over high heat to 350ºF (180ºC). Place the empanadas in the oil and cook for 2-3 minutes or until brown on both sides.
Enjoy!
