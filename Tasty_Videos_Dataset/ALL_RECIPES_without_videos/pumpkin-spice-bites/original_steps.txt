In a medium bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, almond butter, maple syrup, and vanilla, and stir until smooth.
Add the oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt, and mix until evenly distributed.
Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Use a tablespoon to scoop out the mixture, then roll into balls with your hands.
Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
Enjoy!
