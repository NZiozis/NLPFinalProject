In a large bowl, add black beans, rice, corn, seasonings, and egg.
Using a potato masher, mash the ingredients until thoroughly mixed together.
Once mashed, add the bread crumbs and mix to combine.
Take a quarter of the mixture and shape it into a patty using your hands.
Repeat with the remaining mixture to create four patties.
In a pan, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat.
Add the patties and cook for 4-5 minutes, flip, top with a slice of pepper jack, and cook for another 4-5 minutes.
Place patties on buns, and top with sliced tomato, red onion, avocado, and fresh salsa.
Enjoy!
