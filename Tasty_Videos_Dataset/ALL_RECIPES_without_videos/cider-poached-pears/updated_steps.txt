Peel the pear, cut in half and core.
Add the cider, orange juice, star anise, cinnamon stick and vanilla extract to a small to medium pan.
Bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer.
Add the pear halves and poach at a low-medium heat for 10-20 minutes (until you can stick a knife through with no resistance).
Remove the pear halves when cooked.
Reduce the rest of the mixture over a medium heat until it is a thicker glaze.
Serve the pears with a dollop of greek yogurt, a handful of toasted almonds and the glaze.
Enjoy!
