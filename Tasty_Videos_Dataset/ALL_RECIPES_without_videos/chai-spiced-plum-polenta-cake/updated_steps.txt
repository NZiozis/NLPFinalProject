Preheat the oven to 350°F (180˚C).
Grease a 9-inch (23-cm) round cake pan with olive oil, using a paper towel to spread evenly.
In a large bowl, combine the polenta, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Stir well.
Zest and juice the orange.
Add the orange zest and juice to a separate large bowl with the eggs, olive oil, maple syrup, vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.
Whisk well to combine.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and gently fold with a rubber spatula until fully incorporated.
Fold in the diced plums.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Arrange the sliced plum decoratively on top of the cake in a circular pattern.
Bake the cake for 50-55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool for 20 minutes, then remove from the cake pan.
Slice and serve with whipped cream and more orange zest, if desired.
Enjoy!
