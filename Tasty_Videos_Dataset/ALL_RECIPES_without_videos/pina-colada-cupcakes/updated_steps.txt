Whisk the melted butter and sugar together until noticeably thicker in consistency (about 3 minutes).
Add the eggs, coconut rum, pineapple juice and coconut cream and whisk again until combined.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt.
Add gradually to the butter and rum mixture, mixing each time.
Pour the cake batter into a jug and then pour into 12 cupcake cases, about ¾ of the way up.
Bake for 15-18 minutes at 180°C (350˚F).
Once the cupcakes are out and have cooled, prepare the topping.
Whisk the icing sugar, butter, double cream, coconut rum and pineapple juice together until thick and creamy.
Using a piping bag or zip top bag with a small corner cut off, pipe the topping onto the cupcakes and decorate with some dessicated coconut, cherries and a straw.
Enjoy!
