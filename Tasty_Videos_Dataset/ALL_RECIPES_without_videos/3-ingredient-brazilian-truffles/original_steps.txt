Put a pot on a medium low heat and melt the butter with the condensed milk.
Stir in the cocoa powder and continue to stir for 10-15 minutes until the mixture begins to pull away from the edge of the pot.
Itâ€™s done when you run the spoon through the centre of the mixture and it takes a few seconds to combine again.
Spread the mixture onto a buttered plate and refrigerate for 2 hours.
When set, roll the mixture into small balls and coat them in the chocolate sprinkles (you may need to apply a small amount of butter to your hands to help them from sticking).
Enjoy!
