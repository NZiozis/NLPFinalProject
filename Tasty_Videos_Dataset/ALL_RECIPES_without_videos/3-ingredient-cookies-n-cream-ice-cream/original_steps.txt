Separate cookies and cream filling into two different bowls.
Pour the cookies into a plastic bag and smash with a rolling pin until they are crumbs.
Combine crumbs and condensed milk in a bowl, mix together and set aside.
In a large bowl, whip your heavy cream with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form.
Fold the cookie mix into the whipped cream and transfer to a deep baking dish. Top with additional cookie crumbs and cream.
Freeze for 4 hours.
Enjoy!
