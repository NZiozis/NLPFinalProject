Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Add the acorn squash to a baking sheet and season with salt, pepper, maple syrup, and two tablespoons of olive oil. Toss to coat, then spread in a single layer.
Bake for one hour, or until the squash is tender and golden brown.
Heat the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, fennel, and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
Add the sausage and sage, stir, and cook until the vegetables are fully softened and the meat is browned.
Transfer the sausage and vegetable mixture to a large rectangle baking dish. Add the roasted squash, cubed bread, cranberries, and hazelnuts. Toss to combine.
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, chicken broth, pepper, and salt. Pour the egg mixture over the stuffing, then toss well to distribute and coat everything evenly.
Bake for 1 hour, or until the stuffing puffs up, browns, and dries slightly. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
