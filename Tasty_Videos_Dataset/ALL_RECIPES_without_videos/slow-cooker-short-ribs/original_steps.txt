In a bowl, mix BBQ sauce, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, cumin, oregano, and Â½ teaspoon of salt until well combined.
Place bone-in short ribs in the bottom of a 6-quart (6 liters) slow cooker.
Add the spice mix over the meat.
Throw in the baby potatoes and add a pinch of salt, then add onion, garlic, and baby carrots.
Cover and cook on low heat for 7-8 hours, or high for 3-4 hours.
Add green beans during the last 30 minutes of cooking time.
Enjoy!
