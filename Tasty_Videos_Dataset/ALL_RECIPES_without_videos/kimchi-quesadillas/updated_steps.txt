Drain kimchi and roughly chop.
Add butter to a large skillet over medium-high heat.
When melted, add kimchi.
Cook and stir for about 6 minutes until the edges of the kimchi start to turn a golden brown.
Transfer to a bowl and let it cool down.
Add the kimchi, cheese, and sesame seeds to a tortilla.
Fold the tortilla in half.
Pour oil into a large skillet over medium heat.
Fry the quesadilla for about two minutes on each side, or until the tortilla has turned a golden brown and the cheese has melted.
Serve with a garnish of diced green onions and sesame seeds.
Slice into quarters.
NOTE: Experiment with proteins by adding beef, pork, or chicken to the quesadillas.
For even more of a Korean influence, try adding Korean BBQ-style proteins!
Enjoy!
