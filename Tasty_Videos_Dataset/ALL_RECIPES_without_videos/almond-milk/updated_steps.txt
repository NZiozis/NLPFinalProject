In a medium bowl, soak 1 cup of raw almonds in 2 cups (.5 L) of water overnight.
Drain the bowl of water and place the almonds in a blender.
Add 1 tablespoon vanilla, 3 tablespoons honey, 1 pinch of salt, and 4 cups (1 L) of water to the blender.
Blend the mixture on high for 90 seconds.
Use a cheesecloth to strain the liquid into a pouring container.
(Optional) refrigerate 1-2 hours or serve immediately.
Enjoy!
