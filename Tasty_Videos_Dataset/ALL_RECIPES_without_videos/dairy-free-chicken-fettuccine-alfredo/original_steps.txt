Season the chicken all over with 1½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chicken breasts, 2 at a time, and cook for 4-5 minutes, until golden brown. Add more olive oil, if needed, and Flip and cook on the other side for 4-5 minutes more, until golden brown and the internal temperature reads 165ºF (75˚C). Remove from the pan, set aside, and cover to keep warm while you repeat with the remaining chicken.
Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Once at a rolling boil, generously salt the water then add the fettuccine. Cook according to the package instructions. Drain and return to the pot.
Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the shallots and garlic, season with a pinch of salt, and cook until the shallot is translucent, 3-4 minutes.
Stir in the flour and whisk for 3-4 minutes, until golden brown. Add the coconut milk and chicken stock. Bring up to a low boil and cook for about 1 minute, then reduce the heat to low-medium and cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and season with the remaining 2 teaspoons salt and 1½ teaspoons pepper.
Pour the sauce over the fettuccine and toss well to coat. Slice the chicken.
Divide the pasta between bowls and top with the chicken. Garnish with parsley and serve.
Enjoy!
