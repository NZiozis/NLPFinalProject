In a small pot, combine the guajillos, anchos, chiles de árbol, halved tomato, and water. Bring to a boil over [level] heat. Cover cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until the peppers are rehydrated and softened.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peppers and tomato to a blender. Add the onion, garlic, salt, and about ½ cup (60 g) of the pepper cooking liquid. Blend until smooth, adding more liquid as needed if the sauce is too thick.
Cut the corn tortillas into triangles. Add to a cast iron with around 2 cups (480 ml) of heated oil.
Fry the tortilla triangles until golden and crispy. Leaving the chips in the pan, remove all but 2 tablespoons of the hot oil.
Add the eggs to the pan and stir around with the chips. Once the eggs are almost set, pour in the chile sauce and stir until well-combined.
Top the chilaquiles with queso fresco, red onion, avocado, and cilantro.
Serve immediately.
Enjoy!
