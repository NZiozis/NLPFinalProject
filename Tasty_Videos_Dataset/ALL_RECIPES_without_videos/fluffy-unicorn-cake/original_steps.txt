Preheat the oven according to the package instructions. Line a 9-inch round cake pan with parchment paper and grease well.
Pour the cake mix into a large bowl and add water. Mix well.
Divide the cake batter evenly between three bowls and add a different food coloring to each one, mixing well.
Pour the batters into the prepared cake pan. Bake according to the package instructions, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool, then invert the cake onto a serving plate, removing the parchment paper.
In a large skillet over medium heat, add Â½ cup water, the marshmallows, powdered sugar, butter, and blue food coloring. Stir, and cook until the marshmallows melt completely and the color is even.
Pour the marshmallow mixture over the cake, top with multi-colored sprinkles, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
