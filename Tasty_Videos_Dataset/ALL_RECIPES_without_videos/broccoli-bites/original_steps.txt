Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
To make the flax egg, combine the flax meal and water in a small bowl and set aside.
Over high heat, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the broccoli florets and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board.
Finely chop florets to the consistency of rice.
Transfer the broccoli to a medium bowl and add the quinoa, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, nutritional yeast, baking powder, flax egg, and flour. Stir well until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
Use your hands to form bite-sized patties, about 1½-2 tablespoons each.
Place the bites on a greased baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.
Serve with ketchup (optional).
Enjoy!
