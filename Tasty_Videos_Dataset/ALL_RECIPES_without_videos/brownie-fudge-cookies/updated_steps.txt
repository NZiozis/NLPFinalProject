Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180°C) and line a baking tray with grease proof paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and eggs.
Next, whisk in the butter, chocolate, and vanilla extract.
Fold in the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Finally mix in the chocolate chips.
Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes, until slightly set.
Scoop golf ball-size dollops of cookie dough onto the baking tray, making sure you leave enough room for them to spread out.
Bake for 12 minutes, until crispy on top and slightly gooey in the middle.
Enjoy!
