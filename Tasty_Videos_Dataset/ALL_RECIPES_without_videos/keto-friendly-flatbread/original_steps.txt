In a medium bowl, combine the mozzarella and cream cheese. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the cheese is fully melted and the consistency is smooth, about 1 minute total.
Let the mixture cool for a few minutes to prevent the egg from scrambling, then add the egg, almond flour, garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper, and stir until thoroughly combined.
Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or grease with nonstick spray.c
Transfer the mixture to the baking sheet. Press and flatten firmly into an even layer about ¼-½-inch (½-1 ¼cm) thick.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown.
Serve as desired: slice into chips, cut into breadsticks, or top with your favorite sauce and toppings to make a pizza.
Enjoy!
