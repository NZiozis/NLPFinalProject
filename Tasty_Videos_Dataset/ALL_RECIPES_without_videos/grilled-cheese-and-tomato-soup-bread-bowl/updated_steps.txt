Remove the top of the roll.
Using a small knife cut around the inside of the bread (being careful not to cut through the sides) and scoop out the center of the roll - save this for later.
Butter the inside of the roll and place 3-4 cheese slices around the inner edge of the bread bowl.
Bake in a preheated oven at 375˚F (190˚C) until the cheese has melted.
Cut the saved center of the roll in half.
Butter both sides and create a cheese sandwich.
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat and fry the sandwich until both sides are browned and the inner cheese has melted.
Remove the bread bowl from the oven.
Fill with tomato soup and serve with the grilled cheese.
Enjoy!
