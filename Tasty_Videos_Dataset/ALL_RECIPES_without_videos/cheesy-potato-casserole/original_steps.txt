Place potatoes on a baking sheet and poke holes in two sides with a fork.
Coat potatoes with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Bake for at 425°F (220°C) for 45 minutes.
Remove potatoes from oven, and let cool. Chop into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) pieces.
Lay half of the potatoes on the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
Sprinkle on half of the bacon, spread half of the sour cream, and sprinkle on half of the cheese.
Repeat for a second layer.
Bake for 20 minutes at reduced temp of 350°F (180°C), or until cheese is golden brown and the edges start crisping up.
Sprinkle with chives.
Enjoy!
