Add chickpeas, garlic, tahini, lemon juice, and seasonings to the bowl of a 2-quart food processor. Blend until smooth.
While blending, slowly add in the olive oil and water until hummus is creamy and smooth.
Garnish with additional red pepper flakes, chopped parsley, and a drizzle of olive oil.
Enjoy!
