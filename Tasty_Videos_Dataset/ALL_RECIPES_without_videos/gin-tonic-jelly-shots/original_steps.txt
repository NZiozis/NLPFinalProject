Cut the lemons and limes in half and hollow them out. Leave aside.
Soften gelatin leaves in tepid water for 5-10 mins, then remove and wring out.
Boil the gelatin in 100ml (Â½ cup) of the tonic water until dissolved, then add sugar and stir.
Remove from heat.
Add the remainder of the cold tonic water.
Zest some lemon and lime into the mixture and stir.
Add the gin and stir.
Pour mixture into the hollowed out lemon and lime halves.
Refrigerate for 3-4 hours until set.
Flip the lemons and limes over so that the rind is facing skyward, then cut in half.
Enjoy!
