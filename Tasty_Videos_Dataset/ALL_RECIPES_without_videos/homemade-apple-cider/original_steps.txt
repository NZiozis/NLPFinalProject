Place fruit and spices into a slow cooker.
Add 8 cups of water.
Cook on high heat for 3-4 hours.
Uncover the slow cooker, and mash the softened fruit with a potato masher.
Cover again and cook on low for 1-2 hours.
Strain out fruit and spices from the slow cooker into a cheesecloth in a bowl.
Wait about 20-30 minutes for the cheesecloth to cool. Squeeze out cider from cheesecloth into the bowl. Pour the cider back into the slow cooker.
Serve warm.
Enjoy!
