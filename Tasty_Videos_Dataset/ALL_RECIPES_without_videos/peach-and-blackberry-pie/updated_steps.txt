In the bowl of a food processor, add the flour, sugar, and salt, and pulse to combine.
Add the cubed butter and pulse until the butter is incorporated and the size of peas.
Add the buttermilk and pulse until the dough just comes together.
Gather the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap.
Refrigerate for one hour.
In a medium bowl, combine the peaches, blackberries, brown sugar, bourbon (or vanilla extract), corn starch, lemon zest, cinnamon, and pinch of salt.
Set aside.
Remove the pie dough from the refrigerator.
Divide into two equal halves and roll each half out to ⅛-inch (3 cm) thick.
Transfer one round of pie dough to a pie plate and trim the edges making sure none hangs over the edge.
Chill in the refrigerator until ready to use.
With the second pie crust, cut out 20 ½-inch (1 cm) long strips.
Fill the pie plate with the peach and blueberry mixture, then make a herringbone or lattice crust with the remaining crust strips.
In a bowl, whisk the egg and water until well combined.
Brush the top of the crust with the egg wash, and sprinkle with turbinado sugar.
Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Chill the pie in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Bake the pie for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
Let pie sit at room temperature for at least 3 hours before serving.
Enjoy!
