Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
Make the maple cream cheese filling: In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla, and maple syrup. Stir until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
Make the pumpkin cake: Sift the flour into a large bowl and add the brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to combine.
In a medium bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, water, and vanilla. Whisk well.
Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, folding with a rubber spatula just until combined. Do not overmix the batter.
Generously grease a bundt pan with nonstick spray.
Add 3 cups (675 G) of pumpkin batter to the pan and spread evenly. Then, scoop the cream cheese filling over the batter, making a ring. Top with the remaining batter and spread to cover the filling.
Bake for 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before inverting to remove from the pan.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
