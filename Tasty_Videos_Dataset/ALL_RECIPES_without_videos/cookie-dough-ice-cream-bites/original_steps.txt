In a large bowl, mix together brown sugar and softened butter.
Mix in vanilla extract and milk until well-combined.
Add flour and salt, and continue mixing until you’ve reached a dough-like consistency.
Spread the “dough” mixture evenly on the bottom of a parchment-lined 9 × 9 inch (22 x 22 cm) pan.
Sprinkle about half of the chocolate morsels over the dough so that they are evenly distributed, and then press the morsels into the dough with a sheet of parchment paper.
Scoop softened ice cream on top of the dough mixture, and spread evenly.
Freeze overnight or until frozen.
In a small bowl, melt the remaining chocolate morsels with coconut oil until smooth.
Lift ice cream out using the parchment, then cut into an 8 x 8 grid.
Evenly coat each piece with the melted chocolate.
Place back in the freezer for 30 minutes.
Enjoy!
