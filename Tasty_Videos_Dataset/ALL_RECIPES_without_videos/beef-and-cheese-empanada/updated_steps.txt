Heat oil in a large skillet.
Cook down onions until translucent.
Add meat, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper, and cook until meat is fully cooked.
Transfer into a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Combine cheese, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
Mix thoroughly.
Roll out the pie crust and cut into 4 pieces.
Place a spoonful of the stuffing on one side of the dough, leaving ¼ inch (6 mm) from the edge and fold over, creating a triangle.
With a fork, crimp down the 2 sides so the stuffing stays in.
Transfer onto baking sheet.
Brush on egg and sprinkle on sesame seeds.
Bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown and pie crust is thoroughly cooked.
Let it cool for a few minutes
Enjoy!
