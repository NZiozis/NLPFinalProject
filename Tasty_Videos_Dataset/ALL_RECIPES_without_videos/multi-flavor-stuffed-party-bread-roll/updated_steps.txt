Place the mozzarella slices on top of the ham.
Place the remaining ham slices on top of the mozzarella.
Spread spinach artichoke dip on the middle third of the pizza dough, leaving 2 inches (5 cm) at the top.

Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella over the tomato sauce.
Place half the pepperoni slices on top of the shredded mozzarella.
Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella on top of pepperoni.
Followed by the remaining pepperoni on top of the shredded mozzarella.
Starting with the edge closest to you, roll up the pizza dough.

Cut 9 even 2-inch (5-cm) slits across the top of the roll.
In a medium bowl, combine the melted butter, parsley, and garlic powder.
