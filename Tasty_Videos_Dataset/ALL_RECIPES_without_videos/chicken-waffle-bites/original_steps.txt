In a small bowl, combine the mustard, maple syrup, and honey. Stir until smooth, then set aside.
Cube the chicken breast, then season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, vanilla, and oil.
Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar, and a pinch of salt into a separate large bowl. Add the wet ingredients and stir to combine.
Add the seasoned chicken to the waffle batter and toss until well coated.
Heat a waffle iron on the lowest setting.
Spoon a piece of chicken and some batter into each section. Cook for 8-10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the waffles are golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.
Serve with the sauce for dipping.
Enjoy!
