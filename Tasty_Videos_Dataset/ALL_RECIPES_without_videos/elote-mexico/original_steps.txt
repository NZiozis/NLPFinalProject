Blanch the corn in a large pot of boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove the corn from the pot.
Heat the canola oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add the corn and cook, turning occasionally, until nicely browned on all sides. Transfer to a serving plate.
In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, and lime juice. Brush all over the corn.
Sprinkle the corn with the chipotle powder, cotija cheese, and cilantro.
Enjoy!
