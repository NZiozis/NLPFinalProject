Place the chicken breasts, 2 teaspoons of salt, peppercorns, onion, whole garlic cloves, bay leaves, and water in a large pot.
Cover the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Once the water is simmering, cook for 10 minutes, until the chicken registers 165°F (74°C) when pierced with an instant-read thermometer.
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and discard the cooking liquid.
Using 2 forks, pull the chicken apart until shredded.
In a large nonstick pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
Add the corn, bell pepper, and a pinch of salt and sauté until the vegetables have softened, about 2 minutes.
Add the chipotle peppers and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add the shredded chicken and mix until everything is well incorporated.
Add the lime juice and mix to incorporate.
Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool for 5 minutes before spooning into the lettuce leaves.
Top with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro.
Enjoy!
