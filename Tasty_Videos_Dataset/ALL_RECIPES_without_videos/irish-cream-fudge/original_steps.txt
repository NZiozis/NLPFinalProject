In a saucepan, melt the butter, brown sugar, golden syrup, and double cream over a low-medium heat and mix gently until combined.
Once combined, place a sugar thermometer into the saucepan and heat the mixture until it reaches 116˚C (240˚F), stirring every now and then.
Take off the heat and mix in the dark chocolate and Irish cream.
Pour into a baking tin and then pour the white chocolate in the middle.
Using a cocktail stick or the handle of a spoon, swirl the white chocolate into the dark chocolate mixture.
Chill in the fridge until solid. Cut into squares.
Enjoy!
