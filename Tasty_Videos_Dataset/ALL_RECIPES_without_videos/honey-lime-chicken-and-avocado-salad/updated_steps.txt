In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients for the chicken marinade.
Toss in the chicken thighs and marinate for at least one hour.
In a cast-iron skillet, cook chicken on high heat until there is a nice sear on the surface of the chicken, and the inside is no longer pink.
Roughly four minutes each side.
Set chicken aside.
Place chopped lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, and avocados in a large salad bowl.
Slice cooked chicken thighs and add to the salad bowl.
In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the dressing.
Mix well.
Toss the salad with the dressing and serve immediately.
Enjoy!
