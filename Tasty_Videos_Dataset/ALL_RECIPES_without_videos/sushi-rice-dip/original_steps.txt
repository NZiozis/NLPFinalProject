Wash and rinse the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch. Cook in a medium pot at high until the water reaches a boil. turn to low heat, and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.
While there is still some water in the pot, add the vinegar and sugar. Stir and remove from heat.
In a separate pan, add the oil and mushrooms. Cook until they begin to brown.
Add the soy sauces, green onions, and brown sugar. simmer for 2-3 minutes, adding small amounts of water if necessary.
Spray a square or round bowl with cooking oil, and press the rice into the edges with the back of a spoon.
Layer avocado slices around the edges and bottom of the rice.
Spoon in the mushroom sauce. Cover and pat down another layer of rice to seal in the goodness!
Place a serving plate on top of the bowl and flip upside-down. Remove the bowl carefully.
Sprinkle with black sesame seeds. Use a seaweed snack to grab.
Enjoy!
