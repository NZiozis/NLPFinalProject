Prepare the coconut cream by whipping the coconut cream and icing sugar together, until you form soft peaks.
Leave to chill in the fridge until set, for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180°C (350˚F) and line a cupcake tray with 12 cases.
Make the cupcakes by mixing the coconut oil, maple syrup, and almond milk together.
Fold in the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Spoon into the cupcake cases.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown and springy to the touch.
While the cakes are baking, make the strawberry champagne syrup by bringing the sugar, water, strawberries, and champagne to the boil in a saucepan over a medium-high heat.
Simmer until the syrup is slightly thicker and has changed colour to a deep red.
Set aside.
Take the cakes out of the oven and leave to cool slightly for a couple of minutes.
Poke several holes in each one and pour about 2 teaspoons of the strawberry champagne syrup on top, so that it seeps into the holes and is glistening on top.
Spoon the coconut cream on top and garnish with a strawberry.
Enjoy!
