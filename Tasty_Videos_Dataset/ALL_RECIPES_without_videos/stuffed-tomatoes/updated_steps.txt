Cut off the top of the tomato and remove the insides.
Fill with cooked sausage, crack in an egg and added shredded cheese.
Drizzle some olive oil over the top.
Bake in oven at 425°F (218°C) for 15 - 20 minutes, depending on how well done you like your egg.
Season with some pepper and garnish with basil.
Enjoy!
