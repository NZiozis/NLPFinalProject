Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C).
In a small bowl, mix honey soy marinade ingredients.
Lay the salmon on a baking sheet. Pour the marinade over the salmon.
Lay the broccoli beside the salmon, but not touching. Drizzle olive oil over the broccoli, then season with salt and pepper.
Bake for 10-12 minutes.
Top with sliced green onions.
Enjoy!
