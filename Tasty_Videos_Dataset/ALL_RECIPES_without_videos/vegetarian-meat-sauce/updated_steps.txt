In a food processor, pulse the mushrooms and onions until broken into uniformly fine pieces, about 10 pulses, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat.
Pour the mushrooms and onions into the skillet and season with salt and pepper.
Sauté until the veggies have released moisture and softened, about 8 minutes.
Add the garlic and oregano.
Sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Push the veggies to the sides of the pan and add the tomato paste, slowly mixing in the veggies from the side until a uniform paste has formed.
Add the crushed tomatoes and stir until well combined and thick.
Add the vegetable stock and stir until the sauce has thickened slightly.
Reduce the heat to medium-low if it is bubbling and popping too much.
While the sauce simmers, place the chickpeas in the food processor and pulse until broken into fine pieces, about 10 pulses.
Pour the chickpeas into a fine mesh strainer and submerge in a medium bowl filled with water.
Shake the strainer for 1 minute to remove starches from the chickpeas.
You’ll know when to remove the strainer when the water has become very cloudy from the starches.
Transfer the chickpeas to the sauce and stir for at least 1 minute to give the chickpeas time to cook.
Use the sauce as desired for pasta, veggie noodles, calzones, etc..
Enjoy!
