Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
Onto a greased and parchment paper-lined sheet tray, place the pizza dough and spread into the corners of the tray.
Sprinkle the dough with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Bake in the oven for 20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
Remove from the oven and let cool.
In a mixing bowl, add the tomatoes, garlic, basil, parsley, olive oil, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.
Pour the tomato mixture over the cooked pizza dough and spread to the corners.
Add the sliced mozzarella cheese and drizzle with balsamic glaze.
Enjoy!
