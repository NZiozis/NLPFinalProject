In a bowl, combine hash browns, one cup of cheddar (100 g), salt, pepper, and olive oil.
Divide hash brown mixture into the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin. Press the hash browns down firmly along the shape of the cups. Bake at 400째F (200째C) for 20 minutes to set the cups.
Crack an egg into each cup and sprinkle some salt, pepper, and the remaining cheddar on top. Bake again at 350째F (180째C) for 13-15 minutes, or until the egg whites have set.
After they have cooled, remove cups by running a knife along their edges. Serve with all the toppings you desire!
Enjoy!
