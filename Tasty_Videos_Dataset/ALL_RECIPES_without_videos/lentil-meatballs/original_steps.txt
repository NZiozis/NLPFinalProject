Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Heat a large skillet over medium heat then add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, shallot and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until slightly golden brown then remove from heat.
To a food processor, add the garlic and shallot, lentils, egg, 1 teaspoon of olive oil, tomato paste, parsley, Parmesan, bread crumbs, Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper and pulse, mixing until just combined.
Transfer the mixture to a medium-sized bowl.
Use a cookie dough scoop to scoop out balls of mixture then carefully form into balls.
Arrange on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 10-15 minutes.
Remove meatballs from oven and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes.
Serve with spaghetti.
Enjoy!
