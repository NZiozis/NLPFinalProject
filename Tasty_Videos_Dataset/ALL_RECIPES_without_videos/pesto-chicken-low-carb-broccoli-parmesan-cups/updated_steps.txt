Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a food processor add the broccoli, Parmesan, 1 clove of garlic, 1egg and 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
Pulse until mixture forms a dough like texture, about 2 minutes.
Place 1 tablespoon of the broccoli mixture and press into a well greased muffin tin.
Form the mixture into a cup, making the bottom and sides ½-inches (1 cm) thick.
Bake for about 30 minutes until the edges are golden and crispy and the bottom is firm.
Cool the broccoli cups.
Once cooled, remove from the muffin tin.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet medium heat.
Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper, and cook until golden on all sides.
Add the pesto and stir to combine.
Remove from the heat.
Fill the broccoli Parmesan cups with the pesto chicken.
Top with slices of tomatoes and basil.
Broccoli Parmesan Cups can be stored up to 3 days and can be reheated in the oven.
Enjoy!
