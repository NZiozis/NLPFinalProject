Using a butter knife, spread the refried beans in an even layer onto the tortilla.
Add the jalapeño slices and shredded cheese to the top half of the tortilla.
Fold the tortilla in half from the bottom, then fold in the sides, being careful not to tear the tortilla.
Toast on medium-high, until golden brown.
Watch to make sure it doesn’t burn.
Let cool for 1-2 minutes before removing from the toaster.
Serve with salsa, if desired.
Enjoy!
