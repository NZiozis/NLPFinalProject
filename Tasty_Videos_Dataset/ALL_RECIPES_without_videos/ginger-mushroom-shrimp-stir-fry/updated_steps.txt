Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium heat.
Pour in the shrimp and season with ¼ teaspoon of the salt.
Fry the shrimp for 1 minute on each side.
Remove the shrimp from the pan and pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil.
Toss in the mushrooms, asparagus, and remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt and sauté for a few minutes until they begin to soften.
Add in the ginger and soy sauce and sauté until the ginger is fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Toss the shrimp back into the pan and mix until everything is well incorporated and the shrimp is fully cooked, about 1 minute.
Divide the mixture evenly between 4 bowls.
Enjoy
