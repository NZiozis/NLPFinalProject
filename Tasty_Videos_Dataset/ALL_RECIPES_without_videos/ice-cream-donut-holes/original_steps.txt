Open the pack of biscuit dough and cut each biscuit into halves.
Take one half and press it into a flat and circular shape. Place a small spoonful of ice cream into the center of the dough.
Carefully wrap the edges of the dough over the ice cream, creating a very tight seal.
Repeat with the remaining biscuit dough and freeze them for 1 hour.
Heat oil over medium-high heat. Fry the frozen dough balls until golden brown.
Drain them on a paper towel. Freeze for another 30 minutes.
In a small bowl, combine powdered sugar and milk, stirring until smooth.
Pour the glaze evenly over the donut holes. Serve immediately!
Enjoy!
