Using a spiralizer, spiralize the zucchini into thin noodles.
Microwave the noodles for two minutes, then drain any liquid.
Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat.
Cook the chicken, salt, pepper, and garlic until garlic is starting to brown and chicken is cooked.
Add the heavy cream, Parmesan, and parsley, stirring until evenly combined.
Bring to a boil, then stir until the sauce has reduced by about half.
Remove from heat.
Toss the zucchini noodles in with the chicken mixture, and stir until the noodles are coated evenly.
Serve with more Parmesan, if desired!
Enjoy!
