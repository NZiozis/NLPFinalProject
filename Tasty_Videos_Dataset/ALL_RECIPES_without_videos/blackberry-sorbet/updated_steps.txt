In the bowl of a food processor or high-speed blender, blend the blackberries and honey until thoroughly combined.
Pour into a rectangular loaf pan and smooth into an even layer.
Freeze for 2 hours, or until frozen but still soft enough for scooping.
If freezing overnight, cover with a lid or plastic wrap, and let it sit out at room temperature for 5-10 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
