Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C).
In a medium bowl, combine 6 tablespoons of sugar, the flour, and tapioca granules.
Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the blueberries in a large bowl.
Add the lemon juice and stir to combine.
Line an 8-inch (20-cm) metal pie tin with 1 of the pie crusts.
Spoon the blueberry mixture into the crust.
Place the other crust on top.
Press the edges of the crusts together with a fork and trim any excess dough around the sides with scissors.
Brush the milk over the top crust and sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar.
Cut a few slits in the top to release steam as the pie bakes.
Bake the pie for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F (180˚C) and bake for 30-35 minutes more, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
Cool the pie on a wire rack for at least 2 hours to let the filling set.
Slice and serve with ice cream.
Enjoy!
