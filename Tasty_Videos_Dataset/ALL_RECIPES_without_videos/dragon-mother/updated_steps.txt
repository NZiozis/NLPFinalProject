In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together water and sugar.
Bring to a gentle simmer, just until the sugar dissolves completely.
Remove the pot from the heat, add the jalapeño, and cover the pot.
Let infuse for at least 1 hour, or overnight in the refrigerator.
Pour the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer into an airtight container.
Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.
On a small plate, mix together the salt and chile powder.
Run the lime wedge around the rim of a rocks glass.
Dip the rim in the salt mixture.
Fill with ice and set aside.
In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine the grapefruit juice, mezcal, Campari, and 1 ounce jalapeño simple syrup.
Shake vigorously for 20 seconds.
Strain into the salt-rimmed glass.
Enjoy!
