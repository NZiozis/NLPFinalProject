In a microwave-safe ramekin or small bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, Parmesan, rosemary, garlic powder, salt, pepper, melted butter, and egg.
Stir everything together with a fork until smooth.
Microwave on high for 90 seconds, until the bread has risen.
Let the bread cool in the ramekin, then serve as desired.
Enjoy!
