Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Soak the wooden skewers in water to prevent them from burning when baking.
Crumble the tofu into a medium bowl lined with a dish towel. Gather the sides of the dish towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible from the tofu.
To a food processor, add the pinto beans, drained tofu, nutritional yeast, soy sauce, poultry seasoning, garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, and vegetable broth and puree until smooth. With the processor running, pour in the olive oil and continue blending until incorporated.
Add the vital wheat gluten to a large bowl, add the mixture from the food processor, and stir until the dough comes together enough that it can be kneaded. Knead for 1-2 minutes, until most of the cracks have disappeared, then turn out onto a clean surface and shape into a ball. Cut off about ¼ of the dough with a bench scraper and set aside.
Transfer the remaining dough to a small glass bowl. Using your hands, form a hole in the center and evenly stretch the edges to help it expand to about 3-4 inches (8 cm) in diameter.
Scoop the stuffing into the well, then stretch the sides of the dough over the stuffing to encase completely.
Wrap the tofu turkey in parchment paper, then in foil.
Divide the reserved dough in half and shape into 2 drumsticks. Insert a wooden skewer in each one. Wrap the drumsticks in parchment paper, then foil.
Set the tofu turkey and drumsticks on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, flipping every 20 minutes. Remove the drumsticks after 40 minutes.
Serve with gravy.
Enjoy!
