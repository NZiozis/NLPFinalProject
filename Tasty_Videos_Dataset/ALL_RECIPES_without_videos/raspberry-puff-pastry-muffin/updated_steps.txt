Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Cut puff pastry sheets in half, then use a rolling pin to roll each half out to 24-inches (60-cm) long x 8-inches (20-cm) wide.
Brush the puff pastry with the softened butter, then carefully roll them up into a tight log.
Cut the log in half lengthwise.
Take each half and fold the smooth part of the dough inward to create a spiral shape.
Place spirals in a cupcake pan and brush the tops with egg wash.
Bake for 15 minutes on the top rack, then transfer to the bottom rack and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
Remove from the oven.
Once cool, cut out the center of each cruffin and fill with raspberry jam.
Top with a raspberry and sifted powdered sugar.
Enjoy!
