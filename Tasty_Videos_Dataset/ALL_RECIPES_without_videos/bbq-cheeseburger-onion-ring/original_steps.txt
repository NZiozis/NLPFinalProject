In a medium bowl, add ground beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and BBQ sauce. Mix well.
Slice onions into ½-inch thick slices. Take the outer layer off and separate each layer of the rings.
Fill the onion slice with a spoonful of meat. Place cheese cube in the middle and add a little more meat to cover the cheese.
Dredge the onion ring and fry in oil heated at 325°F/160°C for 3-5 minutes or until fully cooked and golden brown.
Serve with your favorite sauce.
Enjoy!
