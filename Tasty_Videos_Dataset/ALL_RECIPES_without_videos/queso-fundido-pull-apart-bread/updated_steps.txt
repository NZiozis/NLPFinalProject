Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a pan over medium-high heat, cook the chorizo until brown.
Add the onions, mushrooms, salt, and pepper, cooking until the chorizo is deep brown and the onions and mushrooms are crispy.
Remove from heat.
Slice across the top of the bread in 1-inch (2 ½ cm) lines, being careful not to cut all the way through.
Rotate the bread 90 degrees and repeat, creating a grid pattern across the bread.
Sprinkle half of the cheese evenly between the cracks of the bread.
Spoon the chorizo mixture on top of the cheese inside the bread, then add the remaining half of the cheese.
Be sure that you fill as many cracks as possible.
In a small bowl, mix together the melted butter, garlic, parsley, and parmesan.
Brush the garlic butter mixture evenly over the top of the bread.
Bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and melted.
Enjoy!
