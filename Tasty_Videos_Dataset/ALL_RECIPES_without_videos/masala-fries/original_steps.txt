Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
Spread out the fries on a baking tray and bake for 20 minutes.
While the fries are baking, prepare the masala.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the oil and butter.
Stir in the ginger garlic paste and fry for a couple of minutes.
Add the onion and fry for a few minutes until soft.
Sprinkle in the chili powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, and lemon juice and stir continuously for another minute.
Pour in the chopped tomatoes and fry for several more minutes, until the sauce has thickened.
Add the fries to the pan and stir until evenly coated.
Drizzle some yogurt on top and garnish with fresh coriander.
Enjoy!
