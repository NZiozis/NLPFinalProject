Blend until well combined.
Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and fold in the chia seeds.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Pour Â¼ cup of batter into the pan and cook for 3 minutes, until bubbles start to form and the edges become golden brown.
Flip and cook for 3 minutes more, until golden brown on the other side.
Repeat with the remaining batter.
Top the pancakes with whipped cream, orange segments, and your sweetener of choice.
Enjoy!
