Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Grease 10 cups of a muffin tin or line with paper liners.
In a large bowl, cream together the granulated sugar and coconut oil with an electric hand mixer until smooth.
Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, vanilla, apple cider vinegar, applesauce, and almond milk, and stir with a rubber spatula until well combined.
Use an ice cream scoop to fill the muffin cups about ¾ of the way.
Bake for 20- 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean
Make the frosting: In a large bowl, cream the vegan butter with an electric hand mixer until smooth.
Sift in half the powdered sugar and beat to combine.
Sift in the rest of the powdered sugar and the vanilla and beat until smooth.
Fold in the sprinkles with a rubber spatula.
Place a large zip-top bag in a tall glass.
Scoop a good amount of frosting into the bag.
Squeeze all of the frosting into a corner of the bag, then snip off that corner.
Pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes in a spiral pattern
Enjoy!
