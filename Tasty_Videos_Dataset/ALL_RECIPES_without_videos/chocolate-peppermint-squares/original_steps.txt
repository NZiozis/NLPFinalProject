Place graham crackers in a gallon-sized re-sealable plastic bag. Crush crackers with rolling pin until fine in texture.
In a bowl, combine crushed graham cracker with melted butter and mix well.
Line a 9Ã—9 inch (23x23 cm) pan with parchment paper. Fill pan with graham cracker crumbs and pat down to create one even, compressed crust. Place in freezer.
In a large bowl, combine ingredients for peppermint cream with hand mixer until a thick, uniform cream is formed.
Remove pan from freezer and layer the peppermint cream on crust in one even layer. Freeze for at least 1 hour.
Remove pan from freezer and cut the sheet sheet of peppermint cream and graham cracker into 36 squares (i.e. 6 lengthwise cuts and 6 crosswise cuts). Place squares on a metal cooling rack.
In a small bowl, combine chocolate and coconut oil (the exact amount of coconut oil needed may vary based on the chocolate used). Microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring between each, until chocolate is fully melted.
Top squares with melted chocolate.
Chill squares in fridge or freezer until ready to eat.
Enjoy!
