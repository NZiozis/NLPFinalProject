First, salt and pepper the chicken breast, dredge in flour, then egg and coat in panko.
Deep-fry until chicken is done, brown and crispy.
Slice and set aside.
In a small pan over medium heat, add onions, stock, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar.
Bring to a boil.
Add the sliced fried chicken, pour in the eggs around the chicken.
Cover with a lid and cook until eggs are at your desired doneness.
Slide the egg and chicken over cooked rice, garnish with chopped scallions and shredded nori.
Enjoy!
