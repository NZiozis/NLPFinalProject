Heat preferred cooking oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, season with salt and pepper, and cook until cooked through and no longer pink.
Add lime juice and cilantro. Stir to combine. Remove chicken from pan, place on a plate, and set aside.
Add a little more oil to pan if needed, then add red onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Stir to combine. Allow to cook until onion begins to turn transparent, stirring occasionally.
Add riced cauliflower, corn, and chili powder. Cook until cauliflower is soft and remove from heat.
Distribute black beans, chicken, and cauliflower mixture evenly between 4 containers. Top with a wedge of lime.
This meal prep can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.
Enjoy!
