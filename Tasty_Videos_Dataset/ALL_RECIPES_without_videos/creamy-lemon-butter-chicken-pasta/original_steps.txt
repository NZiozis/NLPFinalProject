Give the pan a quick wipe with a paper towel
Add butter to the same pan. Fry the onion and garlic until soft (about 3-5 minutes).
Add the lemon zest and juice. Give the mixture a quick stir and add chilli flakes and thyme.
Stir in the water and double cream.
Add the spinach and allow it to cook for about a minute.
Put the pre-cooked chicken back into the pan along with pasta. Allow to cook until al dente.
Mix in the parmesan.
