Roll out the pastry and brush with the beaten egg.
Sprinkle on the paprika and cheese evenly, then sprinkle flour on a rolling pin and flatten down.
Cut into ½ inch (1 ¼ cm) wide strips, then fold in half and pinch the ends together.
Gently twist pastry.
Wrap bacon around the twists.
Sprinkle on brown sugar and minced rosemary.
Bake at 350°F (190°C) for 45-50 minutes, turning halfway through to make sure they are golden brown all over.
Enjoy!
