Prepare the blueberry syrup by combining the sugar, water, and blueberries in a small saucepan over medium heat.
Bring to a boil and then reduce until you have a deep blue, syrup-like consistency.
Set aside.
For the pancakes, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Whisk in the soy milk and oil until you have a smooth, creamy batter.
Heat some extra oil in a frying pan and pour the batter into the frying pan.
Fry for a few minutes on each side until golden brown.
Serve with the blueberry syrup.
Enjoy!
