Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a medium bowl, drizzle the shrimp with oil, salt, pepper, and oregano. Toss until the shrimp are evenly coated.
Transfer the shrimp to a roasting tray and spread into one even layer.
Roast for 6 minutes, until the shrimp have just turned pink.
For the dressing, place the lime juice, water, avocado, Greek yogurt, salt, and pepper in a blender and blend until smooth. Set aside.
In a large serving bowl, toss the romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, and shrimp until well combined.
Transfer the salad to serving bowls and drizzle on the avocado dressing.
Enjoy!
