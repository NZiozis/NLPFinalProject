Slice chicken breasts into bite-sized chunks.
Combine the chicken with the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder, mixing until evenly seasoned.
Place the flour and eggs into separate bowls.
Dip a piece of chicken into the flour, then the egg, then back into the flour.
Repeat with the rest of the chicken.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Fry the chicken pieces until deep-golden brown and crispy.
Set aside on a paper towel to drain.
In a pan over medium heat, mix together the honey, water, hot sauce, ketchup, and chipotle powder.
Bring the sauce to a simmer, and cook for one minute.
Toss the chicken in the sauce until evenly glazed.
Enjoy!
