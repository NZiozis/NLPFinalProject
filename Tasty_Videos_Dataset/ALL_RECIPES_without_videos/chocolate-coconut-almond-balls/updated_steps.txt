In a large bowl mix together coconut, sugar, salt, vanilla, and condensed milk.
If the mixture is too dry add additional milk until it all just comes together.
Roll the mixture into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls and place on a wax paper lined baking sheet.
Freeze for 15 minutes.
Break apart chocolate bars and add to a microwave safe bowl.
Microwave chocolate for 75 seconds, stopping every 30 seconds to check and stir.
Remove the coconut balls from the freezer and individually roll in melted chocolate to coat.
Place back on a wax paper lined tray and sprinkle with additional coconut and top with an almond (optional).
Enjoy!
