Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta for 1 minute less than the package instructs, until al dente. Save 1 cup (240 ml) pasta water, then drain.
Heat a large sautÃ© pan over medium heat. Add the olive oil, butter, and pepper, and stir to combine.
Stir in the reserved pasta water.
Toss in the cooked pasta. Reduce the heat to low.
Add the Parmesan and toss until the cheese is melted and the pasta is well-coated.
Season with salt, if desired.
Enjoy!
