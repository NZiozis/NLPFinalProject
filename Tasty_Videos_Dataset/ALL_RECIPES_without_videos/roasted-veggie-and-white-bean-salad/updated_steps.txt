Preheat the oven to 425°F (220˚C).
In a large bowl, add the white onion, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and mustard.
Season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine.
In a large bowl, toss together 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, broccoli, fennel, garlic, and red pepper flakes.
Spread the broccoli onto a large baking sheet and season with salt and pepper.
Bake, tossing the vegetables occasionally, until tender and golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
Remove the garlic from the baking sheet, and finely chop.
Add the minced garlic to the onion mixture.
Whisking constantly, slowly add the remaining ¼ cup (60 ML) of the olive oil to the onion mixture until an emulsified dressing forms.
Whisk in the fennel fronds.
Add the beans and roasted vegetables, and toss to combine.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Top with the chopped eggs and serve.
Enjoy!
