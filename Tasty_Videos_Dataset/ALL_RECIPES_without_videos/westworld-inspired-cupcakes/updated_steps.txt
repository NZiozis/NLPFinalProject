Add the buttercream frosting to a piping bag fitted with a round tip, then pipe on top of the cupcakes.
Place the chocolate crisps on the cream, concave-side up, and gently press to adhere.
Pipe a small amount of buttercream on the chocolate crisps and place the chocolate caramel candies on top.
Gently press so they stick together.
Enjoy!
