Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
In a large cast-iron skillet, melt 1 teaspoon of coconut oil over medium-low heat. Add the diced apples and let caramelize slightly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove the apples from the skillet and set aside.
Melt the remaining teaspoon of coconut oil in the skillet, then add the quinoa and cook until it is well browned and smells toasty, about 10 minutes.
Return the apples to the skillet, along with the walnuts. Stir to combine, then remove the skillet from the heat and let cool.
In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs, then add the almond milk, applesauce, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Whisk well to combine.
Pour the wet ingredients into the skillet with the apple quinoa mixture. Arrange the sliced apple on top in a decorative pattern.
Bake for 1 hour, until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender.
Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
