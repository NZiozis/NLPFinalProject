Preheat oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Place a 12-inch (30 cm) cast iron pan in the oven and let heat up until ready to use.
In a bowl, add the chickpea flour, water, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and whisk to combine.
Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to broil.
Carefully remove the hot cast iron pan from the oven, and pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, swirling the pan so that the bottom is fully coated.
Gently pour in the chickpea flour batter into the pan, swirling the pan so that the batter covers the entire pan.
Place the cast iron pan in the oven and broil for 5 minutes.
Remove the cast iron pan and top with marinara sauce, leaving a 1-inch (2 cm) border of the crust.
Top with shredded mozzarella and red pepper flakes.
Broil for 2-3 more minutes, until the cheese has melted.
Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and basil.
Enjoy!
