In a medium bowl set over a medium pot of boiling water, melt the butter, cocoa powder, and sugar together.
Add the egg and keep stirring for a minute until the mix thickens.
Remove the bowl from the heat.
Add the graham cracker crumbs, almonds, and coconut flakes.
Mix well, then pour into an 8 x 8 inch (20 x 20 cm) pan and flatten to an even layer.
In a large bowl, cream the softened butter, custard powder, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and heavy cream together until smooth.
Add the powdered sugar and gingersnap crumbs and mix until smooth.
Spread mixture on top of the crust and in an even layer.
Make the ganache: in a medium bowl set over a medium pot of boiling water, slowly melt the chocolate and the butter.
Let the ganache cool a bit, then pour it over the gingersnap layer.
Chill the bars for at least 3 hours.
Cut the bars into 9 even squares and sprinkle with coarse gingersnap crumbs.
Enjoy!
