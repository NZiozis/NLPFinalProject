Reserve any parts that you are trimming off or peeling away (including tops, bottoms, skins, and stems) from the vegetables and herbs suggested above. (Avoid scraps from vegetables like Brussels sprouts, broccoli, or cauliflower, as their strong flavors can overpower your stock.) Place the scraps in a one-gallon airtight storage container, and keep them in the freezer for up to six months. You can add many other vegetable and herb scraps, including corn cobs, winter squash, zucchini, summer squash, beet greens, fennel fronds, chard stems, lettuce, parsnips, green beans, pea pods, bell peppers, eggplant, asparagus, and herbs like dill, thyme, parsley, cilantro, and basil.
Keep adding scraps until the storage container is full.
Transfer the contents of the container into a large pot and fill three-quarters of the pot (or until the scraps just start to float) with water.
Bring water to a boil and then let it simmer for 30 minutes.
Using a sieve, strain the stock to remove the solids. Let stock cool completely.
Stock can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.
Enjoy!
