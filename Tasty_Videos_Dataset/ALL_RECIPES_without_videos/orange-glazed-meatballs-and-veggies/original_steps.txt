In a bowl, combine all ingredients for the meatballs. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated.
Using your hands or a spoon, roll a bit of the meat mixture in between your hands until a meatball is formed. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Next to the meatballs, spread assorted veggies and lightly with drizzle oil, salt, and pepper.
Bake at for 15 minutes, or until meatballs are cooked through and vegetables are soft.
In a microwave-safe bowl, add all the ingredients for the orange sauce.
Stir orange sauce until well combined.
Microwave for 1 minute, stirring at 30 seconds.
Put veggies and meatballs over a bowl of rice and pour the sauce as desired.
Enjoy!
