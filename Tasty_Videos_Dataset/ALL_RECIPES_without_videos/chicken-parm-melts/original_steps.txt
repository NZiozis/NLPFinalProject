Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line a sheet tray with parchment paper.
Debone, remove skin, and shred rotisserie chicken.
Mix chicken with marinara sauce.
Line toasted bread up on the sheet tray and evenly top with chicken mixture. Sprinkle with mozzarella.
Bake for 5-10 minutes or until it is heated through and the cheese on top is melted.
Enjoy!
