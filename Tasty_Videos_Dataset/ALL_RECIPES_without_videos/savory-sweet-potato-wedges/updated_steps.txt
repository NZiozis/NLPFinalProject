Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Cut sweet potato into wedges.
Set aside.
Prepare breading mixture in a large bowl and set aside.
Whisk 2 eggs in a separate bowl.
Dip wedges, one by one, in the egg mixture followed by the breading mixture and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.
For best results, flip halfway.
While wedges are baking, prepare the avocado dipping sauce by mashing the avocado with a fork until consistency is smooth and then adding the other ingredients.
(You may also use a high speed blender or food processor.)
Enjoy!
