Make the basmati rice: Melt the coconut oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods and sauté for 2 minutes, until toasty and aromatic.
Add the soaked basmati rice, water, and salt. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the rice is fluffy. Remove from the heat, fluff the rice with a fork, and remove the cinnamon sticks and cardamom pods. Set aside.
In a large pan, melt the coconut oil over medium heat.
Add the onion and sauté, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until onion is light golden brown.
Add the ginger and garlic and sauté for 1 minute, until toasty and aromatic.
Add the tomato paste, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and cayenne and stir to combine.
Add the yogurt and chicken thighs and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink on the outside.
Add the water, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.
Remove the lid and continue to cook, tossing the chicken occasionally, for 5 minutes or until the curry sauce has thickened to your liking.
Serve the chicken and sauce over the rice with lime wedges and cilantro.
Enjoy!
