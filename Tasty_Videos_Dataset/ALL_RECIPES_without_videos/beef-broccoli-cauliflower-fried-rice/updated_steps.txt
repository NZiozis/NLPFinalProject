Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets.
Place the florets in a food processor and blend until they are a rice-like texture.
Be careful not to over process or it may turn mushy.
Set aside, and drain excess moisture with a towel, if desired.
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the steak until no pink is showing.
Add the broccoli, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and brown sugar.
Cook for 4-5 minutes until most of the liquid has reduced.
Add the cauliflower rice, then cook for about 3-4 more minutes.
Enjoy!
