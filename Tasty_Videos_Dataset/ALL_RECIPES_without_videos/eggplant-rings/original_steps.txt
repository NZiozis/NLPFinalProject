Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray or line with parchment paper.
Cut each eggplant crosswise into ½-inch (1 cm) slices. Use a 1½-2-inch (3-5 cm) round cookie cutter to punch out the center of each slice.
In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Add the eggs to a separate bowl and whisk. Add the flour to a third bowl.
Dredge eggplant rings  in the following order: flour, eggs, and breading mixture. Make sure to coat all sides.
Arrange the eggplant rings on the baking sheet.
Bake for 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown on both sides.
Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy!
