In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the whiskey to a simmer. Turn off the heat, add the raisins, and set aside for at least 15 minutes to allow the raisins to plump.
Drain and reserve the raisins and whiskey separately.
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200˚C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and fine sea salt.
Add the butter and use your hands to pinch together the butter and flour mixture until coarse crumbs form.
Add the buttermilk to the mixture and mix just until a dough begins to form. Add the whiskey-soaked raisins and 1½ teaspoons of caraway seeds. Mix just to combine.
Shape the dough into a 7-inch (18 cm) round. Use a pastry brush to brush the top of the round with buttermilk. Sprinkle with the remaining ½ teaspoon caraway seeds and flaky salt
Cut the dough into 8 triangles and transfer to the parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing the scones 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
While the scones bake, make the whiskey butter: In a medium bowl, add the reserved whiskey to the butter, a little at a time, mixing after each addition until fully combined. Stir in the salt.
Serve the scones warm or at room temperature with the whiskey butter alongside.
Enjoy!
