Make the waffles: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
In a separate large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, olive oil, maple syrup, vanilla, and sweet potato until smooth.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until just combined, making sure not to overmix the batter.
Heat a waffle iron and grease with oil.
Scoop enough batter to fill your waffle iron into the center. Close the iron and cook for 5-6 minutes, until the waffle is golden brown and cooked all the way through. Remove the waffle and repeat with the remaining batter.
Make the cranberry syrup: Add the cranberry sauce and orange juice to a blender and blend until smooth. The syrup should be thin enough to drizzle, but not liquidy. Add more orange juice as needed to reach the right consistency. Set aside.
Make the pecan topping: In a small saucepan, combine the apple, pecans, maple syrup, and water. Cook over medium-high heat until the syrup starts to glaze the pecans and the apples soften, about 10 minutes.
Serve the waffles warm with the pecan topping, cranberry syrup, and a few pieces of goat cheese, if desired.
Enjoy!
