Within the skillet, divide the potatoes into two piles and place a large, circular cookie cutter ring around each pile.
Scoop any potatoes that are outside of the cookie cutters into the center of the rings.
Use a spatula to pat down the piles inside the rings to form patties.
Turn heat down to low and cook until bottom of hash browns are crispy.
Use tongs to remove cookie cutter rings and carefully flip the hash browns to crisp up the other side.
Once crispy, remove from the pan.
In the same pan, add the baby spinach and wilt down over low heat.
Remove spinach from the pan.
Hollandaise: Place egg yolks and lemon juice in a blender.
Blend for 10 seconds, then slowly stream in the hot, melted butter (while blender is still running).
Sauce will thicken by the time all of the butter has been added.
Blend in salt.
Assembly: Place a hash brown on each plate.
Top with spinach, then a poached egg.
Spoon hollandaise over the eggs.
Garnish with chives.
Enjoy!
