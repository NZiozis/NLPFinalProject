In a food processor, combine chickpeas, oats, carrots, red onion, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil.
Blend just until combined.
Add lemon juice and blend again until well-combined.
Scoop out a handful of the mixture and form into patties.
Heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.
Cook the patty 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.
Assemble with your favorite burger toppings.
Enjoy!
