Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
With a sharp knife, score a ring around each potato, just deep enough to break the skin.
Place the potatoes in a medium pot of cold water.
Bring to a boil and cook for about 8 minutes, until about halfway cooked.
Drain the potatoes, and rinse with cold water.
Peel off the skin.
Cut the potatoes into ½-inch (1 cm) pieces and set aside.
Divide the eggplant and bell peppers between 2 baking sheets and spread in an even layer.
Drizzle with 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Toss with your hands to coat.
Bake for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through.
Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes, until semi-translucent.
Add the tomato paste and stir until well distributed, then add the garlic, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and ¾ teaspoon pepper, and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until fragrant.
Add the potatoes, chickpeas, and tomatoes, and stir to incorporate.
Stir in the vegetable broth and cover.
Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
Add the roasted eggplant and bell pepper, and stir to combine.
Cook for another 5-10 minutes, until the tomatoes have mostly broken down.
Ladle into bowls, garnish with parsley, and serve.
Or, transfer the stew to resealable containers and store in the fridge for up to 5 days or freezer for up to 3 months.
Enjoy!
