Pour the crisps into a ziplock bag and smash into pieces using a rolling pin.
Pour into a bowl and set aside.
Preheat a pot of oil to 180˚C (350˚C).
Mix all the beer batter ingredients in a bowl until combined, careful not to overmix.
Cut the chicken into strips and coat well in the batter, then the crisp coating.
Fry for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until chicken is golden brown and cooked through.
Transfer to some paper towel to soak up some of the excess oil.
Serve with chips, your favourite sauces and leftover beer.
Enjoy!
