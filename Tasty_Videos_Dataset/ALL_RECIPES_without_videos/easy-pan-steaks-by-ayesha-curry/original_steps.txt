Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C).
Season the steaks with salt and pepper on all sides.
Heat a large cast iron pan over medium-high heat until just smoking.
Add the butter and olive oil. Once the butter has melted, add the steaks and cook, without moving for three minutes.
Use tongs to flip the steaks over. Add the rosemary, thyme, and garlic.
Transfer the pan to the oven for 7 minutes for a medium steak.
Using tongs, transfer the steaks to a cutting board. Let the steaks rest for at least 5 minutes.
Slice and serve.
Enjoy!
