Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a large bowl, combine the creamed corn, zucchini, flour, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and cornmeal and stir until well combined.
Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray. Using a ¼ cup (30 grams) measuring cup, scoop the batter into pancakes on the baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes. Flip and brush with olive oil, then bake for another 10-15 minutes, until golden brown.
Serve with avocado crema and scallions.
Enjoy!
