Preheat the oven to 350°F (180˚C).
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine the chickpeas, olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt in a large bowl and toss to coat.
Transfer the chickpeas to the baking sheet and bake until golden and crisp, 40-45 minutes, shaking halfway through cooking.
Enjoy!
