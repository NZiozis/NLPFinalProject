Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
In a bowl, add the oats, brown sugar, salt, whole wheat flour, applesauce, and cinnamon and mix to combine.
Pit and slice peaches.
In a separate bowl, add the peaches, brown sugar, cinnamon, cornstarch, and vanilla extract and mix to combine.
Spread the peaches in an even layer in a skillet, and top with the oat mixture.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the peaches are bubbling and the oats are golden brown.
Slice and serve with a scoop of ice cream (optional).
Enjoy!
