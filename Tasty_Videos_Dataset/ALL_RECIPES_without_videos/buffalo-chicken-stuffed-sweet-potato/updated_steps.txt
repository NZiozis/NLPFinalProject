Microwave on high for 10 minutes.
While the sweet potato is heating, season chicken breast with salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Add the chicken and cook until browned, about 4 minutes.
Transfer the chicken to a bowl and shred with a fork.
Drizzle with buffalo sauce and toss until well coated.
In a bowl, add the Greek yogurt, chopped green onion, salt, and black pepper and stir to combine.
Cut sweet potato open lengthwise and fill with buffalo chicken, then top with crema and garnish with sliced green onions.
Enjoy!
